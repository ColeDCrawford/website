    <p>If you are new to cold-weather pursuits, be sure to check out MITOC's
    winter school. For those looking for more advanced options, MITOC facilitates mountaineering
    activities through courses, review sessions, and training.

    <h2>Weekly Training </h2>

    <ul>

      <li><b>Tuesday morning: Resistance Training --</b></li>
      Develop strength to climb harder, prevent injury, and stay below your safety limit.  
      At the MIT Z-center facilities.

      <li><b>Tuesday evening: Group Physical Training --</b></li>
      Simulated mountaineering in the Green Building (54) staircase.  Bring
      water and enough handicap weight to be tired after 1600 vertical feet.

      <li><b>Thursday morning: Resistance Training --</b></li>
      Develop strength to climb harder, prevent injury, and stay below your safety limit.  
      At the MIT Z-center facilities.

      <li><b>Thursday evening: Group Technical Training --</b></li>
      We discuss and practice technical elements of mountaineering in the
      MITOC office.  Topics range from discussion of cases in <i>Accidents in
        North American Mountaineering</i> to practicing knots, ropework, and
      rescue.  During the lighter months, we'll go to the crags for rock climbing.  </p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Weekends: Group Trips</h2>

    <p>We also have practice sessions at the crags, usually about once a
    month.  This spring and last fall we ran 3-session introductory series on rock
    anchors and lead climbing at Hammond pond.  Check it out at the 
    <a href="http://mitoc.mit.edu/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=44906">gallery</a>.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Warning: mountaineering combines the technical difficulties of rock,
    ice, and snow climbing with countless objective hazards including, but
    not limited to rockfall, icefall, avalanches, crevasses, whiteout,
    extreme cold, and may involve rescue times of days, not hours.
    Mountaineering is a serious undertaking with a very real danger of
    death or quality of life impairing injury.  Participants must be aware
    of and accept these risks and be responsible for their own actions and
    involvement.</p>
