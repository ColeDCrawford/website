MITOC started as a bunch of skiers, and sking is still an important winter activity in the club. MITOC runs cross country and backcountry ski trips during <a href="#events/ws.shtml">Winter School</a> and more trips throughout winter.
Join the <a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc-bcski">skiing mailing list</a> to stay in informed of upcomming events.
<p>
The club is most active in cross country skiing and backcountry skiing, and we rent skis for both.
MITOC doesn't do downhill alpine skiing or rent alpine skis, but <a href="http://snowriders.mit.edu">Snowriders</a> serve the MIT community in this area.

<h2>Cross Country Skiing</h2>
If you're interested in cross-country skiing, here are some touring centers, where trails are regularly groomed and tracks made forclassical skiing.
Some of them will also have a limited number ofungroomed backcountry trails. The following list is arranged bylocation.

<h3> Massachusetts</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ski-paddle.com/skitrack/skitrack.shtml" target="_top"><b>Weston</b> Ski Track</a>.<br> Closest to Boston.</li>
</ul>

<h3> New Hampshire: from Camelot </h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.waterville.com/"><b>Waterville</b> Ski Resort and Nordic Center</a></li>
</ul>

<h3> New Hampshire: from Intervale </h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jacksonxc.com/"><b>Jackson</b> Ski Touring Foundation </a>
<br>
~3 hrs driving time from Boston (near Mt. Washington); lots of terrain; whole mixof terrain; A nice area, beautiful.
Since it is based out of a town,the trails didn't feel as "country" like as other places, but still agreat area.
I only spent a day there, so I may not have an allinclusive picture of the place.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.brettonwoods.com/xcountryski/"><b>Bretton Woods</b> Mountain Resort </a>
<br>
The golf course connected to the hotel is a cross countrycourse in the winter. The paths are fun as you cross streamson bridges, and go through meadows.
Quite ideal for beginners. You can rent everything from the ski shopin the hotel.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Vermont </h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.woodstockinn.com/skiatinn2.html" target="_top"><b>Woodstock Inn</b> Ski Touring Center</a>
<br>
Great for classic, fair for skating.  Lots of trails.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.craftsbury.com/xcski.htm"><b>Craftsbury</b> Outdoor Center </a>
<br>
~ 5 hrs (? don't remember); LOTS of terrain; some beginner, mostlyintermediate to advanced; BEAUTIFUL area, feels definitely woods,fields that are away from any city.
Lots of animal tracks.  They get TONS of natural snow a year, so the conditions are supposed to be someof the best around.
Great relaxed, slightly crunchy atmosphere withhome-cooked food and the lodging is dorm style (no locks on the roomdoors - that's the atmosphere).
Definitely a great place for aweekend.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Maine </h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.harrisfarm.com/xc-skiing.html"><b>Harris Farm</b></a><br>~ 1hr driving time(??); med amount of terrain; mostly beginner andintermediate;
IT'S the closest area to Boston I've found that getssignificantly more snow than Massachusetts.
It is literally a dairyfarm, so it is definitely out in the country - you ski across rollingfields and small woods.
Just the right size for a day trip.  AND it'sa DAIRY farm, so you can end the day in their small ski-lodge with aquart of milk from the Cows you can see/visit on the farm.</li>
<li><a href=""><b>Acadia National Park</b></a>
<br>
In winter, you can ski on the carriage roads of Acadia. Backcountrycamping is not permitted in the national park in the winter.
Only Blackwoods campground is open and accessible off-season.</li></ul>

If you enjoy cross-country skiing, you may also be interested in <a href="http://www.xcskiworld.com/">www.xcskiworld.com</a>which tries to cover everything related to cross-country skiing.
Of particular interest may be their information on waxing your skis. </p>

<p>If you're the more competitive sort, check out <a href="http://www.nensa.net/">the New England Nordic Ski Association's site</a>.
They are a comprehensive competition organizer for New England and link to local clubs.</p><a name="bc"></a>

<h2> Backcountry Skiing and Ski Mountaineering </h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been a very active backcountry/ ski mountaineering community in MITOC, organized around the mitoc-bcski@mit.edu <a href="/info/mailinglists.shtml')">mailing list</a>.
Most of us call New Hampshire home, but we report out on trips           all over the place. </p>
<p>If you enjoy hiking during the winter, but relish the thought of strapping skis or a board on your feet and schussing down the mountain instead of plodding your way down, this is the winter pursuit for you.
Some skill and coordination required!</p>

<p>The club rents telemark skis and boots for backcountry skiing. We also have four pairs of skins for rental, as well as two pairs of Alpine Trekkers that allow regular alpine skis to be used with skins for efficient climbing.
We also have avalanche shovels, but not beacons or probes.</p>

<p>Both MITOC cabins are located in prime locations for people wanted to ski the backcountry.
Camelot is right around the corner from both Mt. Cardigan and Mt. Moosilauke, and Intervale is down the road from Doublehead and everything in the Presidentials, including Tuckerman Ravine and the Gulf of Slides.</p>

<h2>Downhill skiing</h2>If you're interested in lift served skiing, from season passes, bus trips, ski lodges to tuning sessions, check out the <a href="http://snowriders.mit.edu">MIT Snowriders</a>.

<h2>Telemark Skiing</h2>                  <p>Telemark skiing, both in the backcountry and some lift served, is a           very popular activity with MITOC skiers. Telemark skiing is a style           of downhill oriented skiing with bindings that connect the toe of a           flexible boot to the ski. It is defined both by the equipment as well           as the style of turn it uses (knees bent, one leg in front, one in back).           Telemark has long been a popular mode of backcountry skiing (although           randonee (alpine touring) and bc snowboarding are growing in popularity).         </p>        <p>The club now rents a limited selection of telemark skis for backcountry           skiing, including a few Atomic TM7s, several Alpina Cross Terrains,           and a pair of Rossignol Hellgates. We have a fleet of Garmont Excursions,           plastic tele boots aimed at the &quot;touring for turns&quot; segment           (as opposed to big and burly downhill).</p>        <p>If you're interested in learning to tele, one of the best places to           start is to by going with other MITOCers to one of <a href="http://www.netelemark.com/">New           England Telemark</a>'s festivals. They offer free lessons with instructors           and are always a lot of fun. MITOC has brought a crew to most of the           festivals for the last couple years. Another outstanding organization           is the <a href="http://www.telemarknato.com/">North American Telemark           Organization</a>, which has a festival and does instruction. </p>        <p>Many club members frequent <a href="http://www.telemarktips.com">Telemark           Tips</a> and <a href="http://telemarkeast.com">TelemarkEast</a></p>        </td></tr><tr>      <td colspan="3"><br>       </td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
