<p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a very active backcountry/ ski mountaineering community in MITOC, organized around the <a href="/mitoc/www/info/mailinglists.shtml')">mailing list</a>. 
Most of us call New Hampshire home, but we report out on trips all over the place. </p>        
<p>If you enjoy hiking during the winter, but relish the thought of strapping skis or a board on your feet and schussing down the mountain instead of plodding your way down, this is the winter pursuit for you. 
Some skill and coordination required!</p>        

<p>The club rents telemark skis and boots for backcountry skiing. We also have four pairs of skins for rental, as well as two pairs of Alpine Trekkers that allow regular alpine skis to be used with skins for efficient climbing. 
We also have avalanche shovels, but not beacons or probes.</p>        

<p>Both MITOC cabins are located in prime locations for people wanted to ski the backcountry. 
Camelot is right around the corner from both Mt. Cardigan and Mt. Moosilauke, and Intervale is down the road from Doublehead and everything in the Presidentials, including Tuckerman Ravine and the Gulf of Slides.</p>
