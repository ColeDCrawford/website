I just got my beloved, 8-year-old boots resoled for $40 at a little
shoe repair store in Allston. If you come dow Comm ave, follow it onto
Brighton ave to harvard street, just past Harper's Ferry o the left
is a little cluster of shops and it's in there. It's a Russian couple;
it oly takes a couple of days ad they ask for a $20 deposit. I got
vibrams put on and they're very solid.

Rock and resole
in Colorado
</pre>

<p>Has a two day turn-a-round. I if you send
them priority mail and ask them to send them priority back you will have
them back in less than 6 days. If you don't need them rereanded I think
it maybe less time. Two half resoles will cost you $23 not including
shipping. The work they did on my aces turnout out pretty good. I don't
know the number off hand.

David's Shoe Repair
803 Mass Ave, Arlington,
on the 77 bus line

You bring the resole kit, and he
uses half the rubber, & charges $16 (I think) for the labor, resulting
in a cost of $26 per pair for each of two pairs.  I know he does a
fair number of climbing shoes, and may also see lots of hiking boots
(you don't specify which kind).  (These prices are from 94-95 2/6/96)
