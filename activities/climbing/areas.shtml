Go <a href="http://bostonclimbers.org/map.shtml">here</a> to find an excellent online resource for where the local crags are! Virtually all of them are described in our <a href="http://www.bostonrocksonline.com/">Boston Rocks</a>. Just do it. Buy our book. Many routes are described
in superb detail. If you're interested in obtaining a copy of the Boston Rocks book you can get a discounted copy at the office if you're a MITOC member.
