<h2>Leadership</h2>
Climbing is inherently dangerous, it is better to obtain
instruction and advice from a more experienced climber rather than
"figuring it out the hard way". As such, MITOC maintains a list of
climbing leaders who have demonstrated an interest in both helping
out the community as well as attention to safety. As the outing club
sponsors sessions throughout the year to learn about climbing
skills, this is the group of people that make it possible.
