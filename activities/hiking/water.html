<h1>Wilderness Water Purification</h1>
<p>1989 by Bill Tuthill
<p>
Unpurified drinking water may contain four things that pose health risks:
protozoan parasites (e.g. giardia), toxic bacteria, viruses, and poisonous
chemicals.  Only boiling and iodine are entirely effective against the
first three, and only charcoal filtration is effective against the fourth.
<p>
Just ten years ago, halazone tablets were the preferred water treatment
method.  Even today, many commercial rafting companies use Clorox(TM) to
disinfect dishes.  Both halazone and Clorox are chlorine-based, and because
chlorine is unstable, slow to disinfect, and pH-sensitive, it is not always
effective against protozoa and viruses.  Halazone also tastes worse than
iodine, so there's no excuse for using it.  US municipal water supplies are
usually treated with chlorine, so your tap water may not always be free of
micro-organisms.
<p>
The First Need(R) water filter is cheap (less than $40), but is effective
only against protozoan parasites.  Its .4 micron filter pores are smaller
than giardia cysts (3.5 microns), but larger than some bacteria.  The
marketing brochure for the First Need says it removes 99% of cholera and
typhoid bacteria, but does not say that E. coli bacteria (which range from
.3 to .9 microns) go right through its screen.  A few years ago my wife got
a case of turista on a Deschutes trip where we filtered all our water
through a First Need.  (The banks of the Deschutes are heavily grazed, and
cattle are prime carriers of E. coli.) The bacteria remained in the filter
and she got the same case of turista the next few times we used the filter,
until we bought a new one.  If you own a First Need, flush it with iodine
as soon as you come home.  The First Need's charcoal canister is not big
enough to be effective against poisonous chemicals -- you need a pound of
charcoal for this -- so the charcoal just adds unnecessary weight, and
provides a potential haven for the growth of harmful bacteria.
<p>
The Katadyn(R) pocket water filter is expensive (around $180), but is
completely effective against bacteria as well as giardia.  Furthermore,
it can be cleaned after it clogs up.  When our second First Need clogged
up (they lasted only one season for us) we bought a Katadyn.  The Katadyn
is effective at removing smaller bacteria such as E. coli.  However, the
Katadyn's .2 micron filter is not effective against viruses.  If you travel
abroad (to Nepal for example), you risk viral infections such as Hepatitis
A and Hepatitis non-A non-B, among others.  In the US, most water is not
yet contaminated by virus, but there's no reason to believe water supplies
will remain uncontaminated for much longer.
<p>
To be entirely safe, water should be boiled for at least five minutes.
Giardia is killed in less than a minute at 176 degrees, well under the
boiling point.  Bacteria and viruses last somewhat longer, but are probably
killed in less than five minutes at 190 degrees.  Some viruses may last
longer; nobody knows.  At 10,000 feet water boils at 194 degrees, so above
this altitude you should boil water an extra minute for each 1000 feet.
Very few river trips start this high, however.  The main problem with
boiling water is that it requires lots of fuel, which may be at a premium
on long river trips.
<p>
If you have neither the time nor the inclination to boil water, iodine
is equally effective.  After 10 minutes (20 minutes for very cold water),
a sufficient dose of iodine kills all protozoa, bacteria, and viruses.
There are many iodination methods, and two excellent ones are commercially
available.  For low-volume purification, PolarPure(TM) is the best product.
After adding water to a bottle containing iodine crystals, you pour a few
capfuls into a liter of water and wait 10 minutes.  The drawback is that a
bottle of PolarPure can purify only 8-10 liters at once.  The advantage is
that iodine crystals are inert and last a very long time.  For high-volume
purification, check out Potable-Aqua(TM) tablets.  Dissolve one or two
tablets in a liter of water and wait 10 minutes.  The main problem with
iodine tablets is that they degrade upon contact with moisture, so be
careful with that bottle, and throw away open bottles when returning home.
<p>
An older method, using tincture of iodine, is definitely not a good idea.
Tincture contains more sodium iodide than iodine, and because sodium iodide
has no disinfectant activity, it unnecessarily increases total iodine
consumption.
<p>
Although iodine is not highly toxic, continuous ingestion of iodine may
cause health problems.  A study of Florida prison inmates who consumed
iodinated water showed that their pre-existing thyroid conditions got
worse.  Also, if pregnant women ingest large amounts of iodine, the fetus
may get a goiter that could cause respiratory obstruction at birth.  The
moral of the story is: don't iodinate all your water for more than a few
months.  The accepted concentration for iodine disinfection is 8 milligrams
per liter, but this is mostly to get rid of protozoan parasites.  A good
compromise would be to filter first, then use a low concentration of iodine
to get rid of bacteria and viruses.  For this, a concentration of .5 mg/L
is deemed adequate, so one capful of PolarPure or one Potable-Aqua tablet
should disinfect around 16 liters.
<p>
Giardia has become a well-known, almost fashionable, outdoor hazard.  Many
people who experience gastro-intestinal problems after drinking bad water
think they have contracted giardia.  In many cases they have contracted
something else.  Since the only FDA-approved treatment for giardia (Flagyl)
is carcinogenic, it's wise to make sure you really have giardia before
taking Flagyl.  Most low-grade bacterial infections go away on their own,
and Flagyl is ineffective against viral infections.  Tinidazol may also be
available in your are, and is more effective against giardia.
