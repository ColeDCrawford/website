Technical Review Sessions (TRS) are mini-lectures in the MITOC office to review and practice wilderness first aid, self rescue, mountaineering, and climbing skills. We recommend joining the MITOC <a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc">mailing list</a> or checking the <a href="/calendar">calendar</a> to stay informed.
These sessions are a great way to refresh and practice skills which are easily forgotten after taking the <a href="/courses">respective courses</a>.
We aim to cover a scenario/skill at each session such as rescuing a follower with a ledge or without a ledge or for first aid run a few scenarios plus discussion.
Sessions are run by people who have taken a course or would like to share their experiences. If you're interested in running a session, please let us know at <a href="mailto:mitoc-bod@mit.edu">mitoc-bod@mit.edu</a>.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
Most organizers and session leaders running Technical Review Sessions are
not climbing guides, mountain guides, certified first-aid instructors, or medical
practitioners. There will be no formal "teaching" or certification. These sessions
are for practice and review. If you are interested in taking a formal course on
self-rescue, general rope techniques, first aid, climbing, or mountaineering
from a certified guide, we suggest you take an official course taught by certified
professionals. Climbing, mountaineering, and general outdoor activities are
inherently dangerous. In the event of a medical emergency, please recognize the
limitations of your training and/or certifications, if any, when rendering assistance
as a volunteer rescuer or race volunteer.
