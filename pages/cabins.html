<p>
MITOC has two cabins in New Hampshire: <a href="#camelot">Camelot</a>
and <a href="#intervale">Intervale</a>. Camelot is near the southwest
corner of the White Mountains region and is about 2.5 hours from
Boston. Intervale is in the eastern part of the White Mountains and is
about 3.5 hours from Boston. The cabins are an incredible resource and
we are very fortunate to have them available to the MITOC community.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Explicit prior permission from the appropriate cabin manager
  is STRICTLY REQUIRED for ALL USES of either property (including
  camping). If you visit either cabin without permission, that is
  trespassing and we (or our neighbors) WILL call the police.</strong>
The cabin managers may be reached at
<a href="mailto:camelot-mgr@mit.edu">camelot-mgr@mit.edu</a> or
<a href="mailto:intervale-mgr@mit.edu">intervale-mgr@mit.edu</a>.
</p>

<h3>Cabin usage procedures</h3>

<p>
All MITOC members may camp on the property of either cabin. Each
member may be accompanied by up to one non-member. Prior permission
from the cabin managers is always required and payment must be
submitted <a href="#pay">online</a> in advance. "Camping" includes the
use of outbuildings such as the lean-to at Camelot or the yurt at
Intervale.
</p>

<p>
Only trained "keyholders" can unlock the cabins. Keyholders may admit
non-keyholders into each cabin at their sole discretion and are
personally responsible for the condition of the cabin and the behavior
of their guests.  Keyholder status is specific to each cabin. Prior
permission from the cabin managers is always required and payment must
be submitted <a href="#pay">online</a> in advance.
</p>

<p>
The cabin managers hold keyholder trainings once every few months.
Keyholder trainings are announced on our <a href="#mailing-lists">
mailing lists</a>. Keyholder status expires after two years of
inactivity. If you want to use the cabin and are not a keyholder, you
must either wait until the next keyholder training, or find a friend
who is a keyholder.
</p>

<p>
As of May 2017, it is no longer necessary to check out a key from the
MITOC office prior to your visit. Instead, the cabin managers will
give you a code to use on the electronic combination lock. When you
make a reservation, the cabin managers will provide more information
regarding this process.
</p>

<h3>Exclusive rentals</h3>

<p>
We normally allow multiple keyholders to use a cabin at the same
time.  For large groups, we also offer exclusive rentals. Only
keyholders may place a reservation for an exclusive rental.  During an
exclusive rental, we will not permit any other groups to use the
cabin, but we may still allow small parties to camp on the grounds.
</p>

<p>
The exclusive rental rate for Camelot is $300 per night, and the
exclusive rental rate for Intervale is $250 per night. This rate is
independent of the number of people in your party.  Payment in full
must be submitted <a href="#pay">online</a> in advance to secure your
reservation.  Exclusive reservations are non-refundable.
</p>

<p>
We do not permit exclusive rentals during certain weekends. For
example, both cabins are used by MITOC's winter school program for
every weekend in January. Always contact the cabin managers before you
submit payment for a reservation.
</p>

<h3>A bit of history</h3>

<p>
Both Camelot and Intervale were constructed entirely by MITOC members.
Camelot was built on a shoestring budget in the 1960s. Intervale was
built from a prefabricated cabin kit in the 1990s after the previous
structure burned down. The keyholder system was created as a result of
this fire.
</p>

<p>
Camelot and Intervale are maintained entirely by volunteer labor. If
you would like to help with projects around the cabins, please sign up
for the
<a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/cabin-helpers">
  cabin-helpers@mit.edu</a> mailing list. We are currently in the earliest
stages of planning for a new structure to be built on the Camelot property
in the early 2020s.
