<p>The Reel Rock Film Tour, one of climbing's greatest celebrations, returns this fall with a new collection of world premiere films. In <i>The High Road,</i> the powerful and bold Nina Williams tests herself on some of the highest, most difficult boulder problems ever climbed. In <i>United States of Joe’s </i>climbers collide with a conservative coal mining community in rural Utah, to surprising results. And in <i>The Nose Speed Record,</i> legends Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold battle Yosemite dirtbags Jim Reynolds and Brad Gobright in a high stakes race for greatness.

<p>In January, 2015, American rock climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson captivated the world with their effort to climb The Dawn Wall, a seemingly impossible 3,000 foot rock face in Yosemite National Park, California.<br />

The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks, igniting a frenzy of global media attention.<br />

But for Tommy Caldwell, The Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22, the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident, but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing The Dawn Wall.<br />

Blurring the line between dedication and obsession, Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt, with the world watching, Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream, or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship?

    <p>No Man's Land Film Festival is an all-woman adventure film festival  based out of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado that meets a need and  desire to highlight and connect individuals who identify as women in  pursuit of the radical. We are a collaboration and celebration of humans  who are deeply engaged in enhancing the female presence in the  adventure arena. The goal of this festival is to connect like-minded  individuals who are action-oriented, wish to support a shared vision of  gender equality, have a desire to experience their passions and  environments through a uniquely female lens, and above all, love  adventure. Along with cultivating a deep interest in exploring the  vastness of our planet from a female point of view, No Man's Land  strives to create a history of motivating audiences to implement and  inspire change. Our mission transcends the films presented; this  festival acts as a platform for progressive thought and movement in the  outdoor industry.  At No Man's Land, we aim to <strong>un-</strong><strong>define feminine</strong> in adventure and sport through film. </p>

    <p><em>A special introduction to the film will be given by Mike McGinn - Friend of the producers, former Seattle Mayor, Cascade hiker, and avid reader of the Beckey guides.</em></p>
<p>Hailed as one of the most influential climbers of all time, Fred Beckey is the original American “Dirtbag"–one who abandons societal norms and material comforts in pursuit of a nomadic mountaineering lifestyle.
This rebel athlete’s lifetime of accomplishments set the bar for the entire sport. He shattered records with an unparalleled string of superhuman first ascents, bushwhacking trails and pioneering direct routes thought previously impassable.
Beckey burned bridges, eschewed fame and stayed unencumbered so his only obligation would remain conquering the next summit. He kept meticulous personal journals where he mused on everything from arcane geology to his romantic life, to the myriad sunrises he witnessed from vantages not seen by anyone else on Earth. An environmentalist before there was such a term, Beckey’s legacy includes 13 essential books that act as blueprints for new generations. He defiantly continued climbing until passing away in October 2017 at age 94.</p>

<p>on <strong>Tuesday, February 28th @ 7:30 PM</strong> in <a href=
    "http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=26">MIT Building 26-100</a></p>
<p><strong><em>This event is FREE and open to the Public!</em></strong></p>
<p>AN AMERICAN ASCENT documents the first African-American expedition to tackle Denali (aka Mt. McKinley, North America's highest peak), while shedding light on the complex relationship many African-Americans have with the outdoors. As the United States transitions to a “minority majority” nation, a staggering number of people of color do not identify with America's wild places. By embarking on the grueling multi-week climb of 20,237ft Denali, nine African-American climbers try to bridge this “adventure gap” - challenging outdated notions of what adventure looks like by changing the face of America's biggest and baddest mountain on the 100th anniversary of its first summit.</p>

    is both thought provoking and inspiring. Along with her media skills she is
    an accomplished athlete in her own right and has skied many high level
    routes and first descents around the world. As a professional athlete for
    Dynafit,LowePro, and Winter Wildlands Alliance Kt specializes in human
    powered adventure. Each fall Kt spends a few months working in the Arctic
    with Polar Bears International as a media specialist, troubleshooting
    wireless internet on the tundra, photographing polar bears, and hosting the
    worlds leading polar bear and climate scientists for large digital outreach
    initiatives. She hopes her work inspires others to take action on climate

snowboarders have fought a proposed large-scale ski resort deep in the Purcell
Mountains of British Columbia. After 24 years of opposition, what more will it
take to keep Jumbo wild for good?</p>

<p>Jeff Lowe&rsquo;s Metanoia is the story of a legendary athlete&rsquo;s rise
to the top of his sport before a devastating fall from grace that precipitates
perhaps the boldest solo mountain climb in history: Metanoia, on the North Face
of the Eiger. Twenty years later, Jeff faces a terminal disease with the same
courage and grace that characterized his career as a climber.</p>

<p>In the high-stakes game of big-wall climbing, the Shark&rsquo;s Fin on Mount
Meru may be the ultimate prize. Sitting at the headwaters of the sacred Ganges
River in Northern India, the Shark&rsquo;s Fin has seen more failed attempts by
elite climbing teams over the past 30 years than any other ascent in the
Himalayas.</p>
<p>In October 2008, Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk arrived in India
to tackle Meru. What was meant to be a seven-day trip with the equivalent
amount of food became a 20-day odyssey in sub-zero temperatures, thanks to the
setback of a massive storm that showered the mountain with at least 10 feet of
snow. Like everyone before them, their journey was not a successful one. But
they had reached further than anyone else, beaten back just 100 meters below
the elusive summit.</p>

<p>Pretty Faces is a film celebrating women who thrive in the snow. The concept
for the film was originated by professional big mountain skier and SheJumps
co-founder,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lynseydyer.com" target="_blank">Lynsey
Dyer</a>&nbsp;with the objective of giving women and girls, young and old, a
source of inspiration through a unique look at what is possible when boundaries
are broken, dreams captured and&nbsp;friendships&nbsp;cultivated. In
Lynsey&rsquo;s words &ldquo;I wanted to give young girls something positive to
look up to…I wanted to give them their&nbsp;<em>Blizzard of
Ahhs</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ski Movie</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>High Life</em>, but done in
a way that also shows the elegance, grace, community and style that is unique
to women in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In its ninth year, the REEL ROCK Film Tour features a special presentation
of the highly-anticipated feature-length film “Valley Uprising.”</p>
<p>The greatest untold story of American counterculture is that of the Yosemite
Valley rock climbers. For the past fifty years, Yosemite’s massive cliffs have
drawn explorers and madmen to leave materialism behind and venture onto the
high, lonesome granite.</p>
<p>The larger-than-life characters of Yosemite carved out an “extreme bohemian”
lifestyle in the Valley, living on red wine and boiled potatoes, clashing with
National Park authorities, and pioneering the boldest climbs on Earth. T he
torch has been passed down across three generations of climbers; through
rivalries, tragedies and triumphs, the art of Yosemite climbing has advanced
beyond anyone’s imagination.</p>
<p>Valley Uprising is the riveting, unforgettable tale of this bold tradition:
half a century of struggle against the laws of gravity — and the laws of the
land.</p>
