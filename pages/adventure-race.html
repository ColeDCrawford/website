<p>
An awesome, 6-hour adventure hunt brought to you this spring by the MIT Outing Club and MIT's <a target="_blank" href="http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/activity/a/asa/resources/large-events.html">LEF</a> Fund.
<p>
<h3> Overview</h3>
<span>The race will be held in and around the Charles River and MIT&rsquo;s
campus. Teams of 2 or 3
will run, row, climb and bike their way to as many checkpoints as possible
during the 6 hour race. Each team will choose their own route through the
course navigating with a map and compass (no GPS!) while optimizing their
potential to earn points. Teams will earn additional points by solving
challenging puzzles along the way. We&rsquo;ll use an open-ended <a <a target="_blank" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogaining">rogaine-style</a>
scoring format to give teams maximal flexibility in developing their
strategy. We&rsquo;ll cap off the day with an awesome BBQ and awards ceremony.
Get excited!</span>
<br>



<h3> Philosophy</h3>
Adventure racing is an awesome team sport that
involves a combination of physical stamina, technical skill,
logistical management, analytical skills and team-work for success.
Adventure racing often takes racers to distant wilderness, which
can create a steep barrier to entry for newcomers. Instead, we wanted to
bring that adventure to you in a manageable 6-hour sprint format!
The Rugged Rampage is intended as a fun introduction to adventure
racing for folks with all sorts of different
skills/interests.

<h3> Scoring</h3>
Checkpoints will be scattered around the MIT campus and nearby
along the Charles River. Each checkpoint is marked by a standard <a <a target="_blank" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wGVr3bIm6ZM/T2Xr2SW47WI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/g88uSAPQWkU/s1600/control.jpg">orange
and white control</a> with a distinctive whole-punch
used to mark the scoring passport each team will race
with. You will punch your passport to prove you have successfully
navigated to a given checkpoint. Each checkpoint will be given a
different point value dependent on its difficulty. Racers can
determine which checkpoints to visit and the order of their
traverse. The course is designed to have more checkpoints than any
team will be able to visit (even <a <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/matthewg/Public/adventures/">these guys</a>).
This will make the course challenging for both
experienced and novice teams alike.


<h3>Unique Features</h3>
You will be running or hiking throughout the race. You will have opportunities to earn additional points through rock climbing and open water paddling. All gear required for climbing or paddling will be provided, but be prepared to get wet!
As this is an MIT race, we will include various
puzzles along the course which teams can solve in order to earn
additional points. None of these puzzles will be required, so if
you get stumped you can move on, but they&rsquo;ll be a lot of fun
and help you earn extra points. Further details about the nature of
the puzzles will be provided at the race start, although the
suggested gear list may provide instructive
clues.
