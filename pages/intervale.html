<h2><u>Important Procedures</u></h2>

A keyholder is allowed to use the cabin (as well as the grounds) after going through on-site training conducted by the cabin managers; a property user can put up a tent or sleep in the yurt, but is not authorized to use the cabin and is also trained by the cabin manager.

<h3>Our Neighbors</h3>
<p>Intervale is not road-accessible. Therefore, we have an easement which gives us a Right of Way (RoW) giving us access to our property. Our RoW passed by a pair other homes and directly across the property of third. It is important that you follow all of the rules below regarding our RoW when you access our property. We must respect our neighbors at all times. Failure to follow these procedures constitutes trespassing.
<h4>Do</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Park in our designated parking area as detailed in the parking section below.</li>
    <li>Stay on the RoW at all times, as a group, on foot, without stopping, and only to access our property.</li>
    <li>Only cross the RoW while being escorted by a keyholder or property user.</li>
    <li>Use a headlamp at night while crossing the RoW, just be mindful not to shine your lamps on any houses.</li>
    <li>Be courteous and respectful of our neighbors and be completely quiet when in earshot of their homes from the time you step off the road until the time you cross onto our property.</li>
    <li>Make sure you are familiar with the information in the <a href="http://mitoc.mit.edu/#intervale-manual">Property Manual</a>.</li>
    <li>Get prior explicit approval from a Cabin Manager to bring animals (such as dogs). Pets must remain on leash, at the owner's side as they cross the neighbors property, and are not to be allowed to roam the Intervale grounds unsupervised as this may result in animals being animals and unwanted interactions with the neighbors occurring!</li>
    <li>Enjoy your stay on the property and be sure to clean up behind you and bring all trash out with you and take it back to Boston for disposal.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Don't</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Driving is not allowed along the RoW without specific prior authorization from the Cabin Managers.</li>
    <li><strong><u><em>Violation of any of these policies may result in the revocation of your MITOC cabin privileges or MITOC membership. Additionally it could constitute trespassing!</em></u></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Cabin Managers can be contacted via email at <a href="mailto:intervale-mgr@mit.edu">intervale-mgr@mit.edu</a></p>

<h3>Parking</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Park at the designated parking area only.</li>
    <li>Leave the two right-most spaces (do not block the driveway) empty, they belong to our neighbors who own the ski-club.</li>
    <li>Drivers who arrive/depart together are encouraged to park one another in. This helps to maximize the space of the lot.</li>
    <li>You may wait in the parking area for other members of your group but you may NOT consume alcohol, block the roadway, create any disturbance, or camp in the parking lot.</li>
    <li>Do not leave any trash in the parking area.</li>

<h4>I am a keyholder and am familiar with the cabin; is it available this weekend?</h4>
Submit a request and the cabin managers will get back to you.
<h4>I am not a keyholder or property user, but I am a MITOC member, can I camp on the premises?</h4>
No, you must be either a keyholder or property user to request a reservation.
<h4>I want to become a keyholder when is the next training weekend?</h4>
There are usually at least two training weekends per year: one in the spring and another in the fall.  Additional weekends may also be announced.  All announcements will be sent at least a week in advance to the main mitoc list.

<h4>I attended a keyholder training weekend three years ago, can I stay at the cabin?</h4>
No, keyholder status expires after two years.  You will need to attend another work weekend to renew.
