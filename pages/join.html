<h3>1. (Optional) Join <a href="#mailing-lists">MITOC mailing lists</a></h3>
<p>
  Mailing lists are our primary way to announce upcoming events and
  organize informal trips. You do <em>not</em> have to pay the membership fee
  to join mailing lists, and paying the fee will <em>not</em> automatically
  sign you up for any mailing lists!
</p>

<h3>2. (Recommended) <a href="https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/accounts/signup/">Make an account on our trips site</a></h3>
<p>
  An account is necessary to participate on official trips, and it makes it easier to pay membership dues and complete waivers.
</p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/membership">Pay your annual membership dues</a></h3>
<p>
  It is mandatory that you join MITOC before renting gear or signing up for a trip.
  <em>Membership dues are non-refundable.</em>
</p>

<h3>4. <a href="https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/profile/waiver">Sign our liability waiver</a></h3>
<p>
  If you opted not to make an account, please use the same email address that you used when paying membership dues.
