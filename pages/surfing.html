  Frigid New England winters are not what comes to mind when one pictures
  surfing, yet the region hosts a thriving surf community. World-class waves
  can be enjoyed among thin crowds within a culture of some of the most
  dedicated surfers willing to sport thick neoprene and surf even in harsh
  winter conditions. We wish to expose MIT students to this culture by
  introducing beginners to the sport during the warm summer months and
  organizing advanced trips when the winter swells hit. We offer a range of
  activities on and off campus revolving around surfing with the aim to foster
  a healthy and environmentally-aware community.
</p>

  As you become a surfer, you quickly realize there is much more to it than the
  time spent in the water. Therefore, we also organize activities ranging from
  balance training sessions, to science of board design, to becoming an amateur
  meteorologist. In addition, we aim to instill a sense of responsibility in
  caring for the community and for the beaches and oceans that provide us with
  this unrivaled experience.

<h3>Ability Levels</h3>
<h4>Beginner – Get Stoked</h4>
<p>
  We want to introduce you to surfing in a way that you will feel comfortable
  and start a lifelong love affair with a hobby that will consume you. Focus is
  on education to facilitate a safe introduction and progression to gain a
  comfort level in the ocean in moderate sized waves. We plan trips to
  surrounding beaches where lessons are provided by either professional
  instructors or one of our surf leaders. If new to surfing, we require that
  you attend a session on surf etiquette and safety before going on a trip led
  by a surf leader. Trips happen in the late spring to early fall.
</p>

<h4>Intermediate – Stay Stoked</h4>
<p>
  For surfers with some experience, we offer trips lead by MITOC surf leaders.
  We also provide board rentals to allow continued progression at your own
  pace. Continue to train on land and sharpen your forecasting skills in
  coordination with our spot guide to find new places that work in various
  conditions. Make sure you are ready for each place, as some breaks contain
  risky conditions. Start thinking about hurricane season and winter surfing.
  Keep pushing, but know your limits.
</p>

<h4>Advanced – Share the Stoke</h4>
<p>
  Ready for hurricane season? Stoked to get into the water but don’t have the
  funds to invest $500+ into a performance surfboard and another $300+ into a
  winter wetsuit, boots, gloves, etc? We are working on creating an inventory
  of rental equipment for all of the above to have you covered when the winter
  swells hit. Furthermore, we plan advanced trips to some of the higher
  performance spots when the conditions allow for it.
</p>
<p>
  Once you are comfortable enough in the water, give back to the surf and MITOC
  communities and become a surfing leader.
