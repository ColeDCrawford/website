<p>MITOC has an active group of cross country and backcountry skiers, with trips typically running from January through May.  If you are interested in learning to cross country and/or backcountry ski, we run introductory trips during <a href="/winter-school">Winter School</a>.  In addition, MITOCers organise trips not only here in the Northeast but across the US and beyond.  Join the <a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc-bcski">skiing mailing list</a> and become a member of our skiing community.  Upcoming trips and events will be announced on this list.</p>

<p>You can rent cross-country, backcountry, telemark, and AT ski equipment from MITOC.  Please see the <a href="/rental">gear rental information page</a> for details.  MITOC does not have downhill/alpine ski equipment for rental.
