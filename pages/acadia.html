MITOC holds an annual trip to Acadia National Park on the central coast of Maine, usually on Memorial Day weekend.
We stay at a group-site campground in Bass Harbor (with hot showers!).
Acadia is on a beautiful island in Maine, 5-6 hours from Boston
with hiking, rock climbing, cycling, kayaking,
canoeing, swimming, beach bumming, lobster eating, and relaxing.
The trips are loosely organized with participants expected to organize
among themselves either before or at Acadia.
Participants are expected to bring their own food, camping gear, and equipment.
(some available to <a href="/rental">rent at MITOC</a>).

<h3>Cost</h3>
Camping is $26/person for the weekend (there are no "daily" rates.)
This only covers campground cost, not gear rental, gas, food, etc.
Space is limited.
You must pay for camping online (credit card) when you sign up for the trip.
Signing up and paying is a commitment, there are no refunds.

<h3>Sea Kayaking</h3>
Ocean kayaking or nice lake if ocean conditions are too rough.
The minimal requirement here is that you must be able to dress for cold ocean water
(i.e. in non-cotton and have arms and legs covered),
be able to swim, and be modestly physically fit.

<h3>Climbing</h3>
Climbing at Acadia requires some experience: you must be able to competently top rope belay, climb 5.4 minimal,
and for some areas, rappeling is required. There is: top rope climbing at ocean side cliffs like Otter Cliff,
Hunter's Beach, and Great Head. There is also trad climbing at Precipice or Bubble Mountain.
