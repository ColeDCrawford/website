<h3>Who are desk workers?</h3> 

<p>Desk workers are volunteers who staff rental office hours, field rental-related questions, and maintain 
    the MITOC office and gear.</p>

<h3>Who can become a desk worker?</h3> 

<p>Because desk workers are entrusted with significant power and responsibility, we look for people who are
    invested in MITOC beyond the rental desk. People who have participated in many MITOC trips/events will be
    considered. Most (but not all) desk workers are also trip leaders, boathouse keyholders, cabin 
    keyholders, or club officers. Desk workers should also have rented gear from MITOC before and be familiar
    with the process.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits of being a desk worker?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>24/7 access to the office, so you can check out/return gear any time you like (unlocking the office door 
        requires a current MIT ID card)</li>
    <li>$15 MITOC credit for purchases/rentals per shift worked</li>
    <li>Get more involved in the club and meet cool outdoorsy people</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the obligations of being a desk worker?</h3>

<p>To maintain card access to the office, you must work desk at least twice per semester (shifts worked during the summer and
    January can be counted toward either semester.) Desk workers who are inactive must be retrained to get their access
    back.</p>

<h3>How do I become a desk worker?</h3> 

<p>Contact <a href="mailto:mitoc-deskcaptain@mit.edu">mitoc-deskcaptain@mit.edu</a> to be considered. New desk workers
    must schedule a training session (roughly 30 minutes) with the desk captain.</p>
