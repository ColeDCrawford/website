<h3>General Guidelines for Reimbursement</h3>

<ul>

    <li>Follow the instructions on this page carefully. If not, your reimbursement may be delayed or we will be unable to process it. If in doubt, email <a href="mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu">mitoc-trez@mit.edu</a>.

    <li>Most of the restrictions on what we can and cannot purchase/reimburse come from the <a target="_blank" href="http://studentlife.mit.edu/sao/finance">Student Activities Office</a> and are non-negotiable. Make yourself aware of these by reviewing this page BEFORE purchasing MITOC items, and do not ask the treasurer to try to skirt these rules.

    <li>To get reimbursed, you must submit i) an itemized receipt and ii) proof of payment. Proof of payment can be a listed credit card on the receipt or as "Balance=$0", "Paid", etc. If proof of payment is not present, a statement with everything except the transaction and your name can be accepted.

    <li><b>KEEP ALL RECEIPTS UNTIL REIMBURSED!!!</b> If you do not have proof of payment, you CANNOT be reimbursed. As of February 2018, physical receipts DO NOT need to be submitted for non-travel expenses.

    <li>For Amazon orders, you must submit the final order details, which are itemized and have proof of payment. This can be found under Your Account >> Your Orders >> Invoice AFTER the order has shipped.

    <li>Avoid cash.

    <li>All receipts should be in USD. If not, include screenshots of official conversions to USD.

    <li>Tip can be reimbursed with proof of payment.

    <li>Sales tax cannot be reimbursed; however, purchases made on MIT's behalf can be exempted from sales tax. Use the forms <a target="_blank" href="http://vpf.mit.edu/forms/7/1220">here</a> (MIT certificates required) if vendors require proof of exemption.

    <li>DO NOT pay more than $1000 for computers/software, or $5000 for other items. Large purchases must be made with requisitions. Email <a href="mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu">mitoc-trez@mit.edu</a> prior to placing large orders.

    <li>If you are paying a single individual (e.g. a speaker), you may need the payee to fill out a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf">W-9 form</a> ahead of time.</li>

Ensure you have access to <a target="_blank" href="http://concur.mit.edu/">Concur</a>. If travel did not involve any personal vehicle mileage:

<ol>

    <li>Fill out the report using the MITOC cost object/account: 2720209. Attach copies of all receipts, but DO NOT SUBMIT YET.

    <li>Generate a <em>Detailed Report with Allocation Summary</em> from the Print/Email dropdown and send to <a href="mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu">mitoc-trez@mit.edu</a>.

    <li>Treasurer will reply with a signed approval form, which should then be attached to Concur report and submitted.</li>

</ol>

Personal mileage can be reimbursed using Concur, however, that reimbursement rate is determined by MIT (~$0.54/mi). Email <a href="mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu">mitoc-trez@mit.edu</a> before requesting reimbursement for personal mileage to ensure correct rate is used.
