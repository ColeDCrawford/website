    <h1>Intervale General Information</h1>
</div>

<p>
Intervale is a rustic cabin located near North Conway, NH off Rt. 16. It is about a 3 hour drive from Boston, and located in the middle of some of New Hampshire's best hiking and skiing areas.
</p>

<h3>Nearby Area</h3>
<p>
Intervale is about a 15-minute drive from rock climbing at Cathedral Ledge or White Horse Ledge, or swimming at Echo Lake. Many trailheads are within a half-hour's drive, including the Presidentials and Mt. Washington, Mt. Kearsarge North, and Arethusa Falls (the tallest and most spectacular in the state). Downhill skiing is available at Attitash, 5 minutes away; Cranmore, 15 minutes away; and Wildcat, 20 minutes away.

<h3>What's at Intervale</h3>

<h4>The Cabin</h4>
<p>
Intervale is our newest cabin and is modern and well-insulated. However, it has no electricity or running water, and users will have to bring all their own drinking water with them or use a spring near the cabin. There is a carpeted sleeping loft that will fit about 12 people. We recommend bringing a sleeping pad and sleeping bag. There is plenty of camping space outside. Intervale has a liquid propane gas stove and heater, cooking pans and utensils. There is also a dining table and plates and cutlery for about 10 people.
</p>

<p>The cost for use is $7 per person per night.</p>

<h4>The Yurt</h4>
<p>
In addition to the beautiful new cabin at Intervale (built in 1994-95) we also have our version of a traditional Mongolian dwelling called a Yurt, constructed in 2015 by cabin managers Kris Brewer and Jen Gagner as well as a diverse team of MITOC folks who volunteered. This yurt was built to replace the yurt built by prior MITOC members led by the illustrious Dave Maltz who completed construction in 1993.
</p>

<p>
It is a somewhat cylindrical single-room structure with a conical roof. Instead of the traditional Yak hides (difficult to obtain in New Hampshire) we used a prefab yurt this time around. This replaced the one originally built using tar paper.
</p>

<p>
The Yurt serves as extra sleeping space at Intervale, and a unique alternative to Western-style cabins.

The cost for use is $3.50 per person per night
