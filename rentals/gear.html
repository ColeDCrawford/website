<h2>Renting Gear from MITOC</h2>
MITOC strives to provide at-cost gear rentals for members.
<ul>
<li>To rent gear, come by the <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=W20">MITOC office (W20-461)</a> during office hours. Office hours are usually <strong>Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7 - 8 pm and Fridays from noon - 1 pm.</strong> Check the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mitoc/www/#jointrip/calendar.html"> calendar</a> for the definite schedule before coming.
<li><strong>Bring your checkbook.</strong> You will be required to leave a deposit check for the value of any gear you rent.
<li> Each MITOC member may rent <strong>up to 2 of each type of gear</strong> at a time. For example, if you need 10 sleeping bags and pads for your upcoming trip, bring 4 friends to the MITOC office when you rent gear (or have them <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mitoc/www/#jointrip/becomemember.html">become a member online</a>), and bring 5 checks to write for deposits.
<li> We charge per day that you use the gear. For example, if you rent a tent during Thursday office hours, use it on Friday and Saturday, and return it the following Wednesday, we will charge for two days of use. <strong> There is a minimum charge of one day's use per weekend that you have gear rented.</strong>
<li>From time to time, we will announce gear recalls by email if we need gear for club trips. If there is a gear recall, you must return any gear you have rented. Otherwise, you may keep gear for up to 10 weeks. But be aware that you will be charged for each weekend you don't return it.
</ul>
<strong>MITOC reserves the right to cash your deposit check if the gear is not returned after 10 weeks and 3 email attempts to contact you.</strong>

<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> We do not accept cash. Gear rentals and merchandise may be paid for by credit card (preferred) or check only.

<h2>Frequent Flyer Check</h2>
Are you sick and tired of writing deposit checks to MITOC?
You can write 2 checks once and not have to write another for a year. We will retain your "frequent flyer" checks as deposit against any rentals.
<p>
Come to the MITOC <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=W20">office (W20-461)</a>, tell the desk worker you want to be a frequent flyer, and hand in 2 checks:
<ul>
<li>a $300 check
<li>a $700 check
</ul>

<h2>Priority for MITOC Events</h2>
During IAP (Jan-early Feb), all MITOC gear is reserved for official
Winter School trips. Those wishing to rent gear for other trips may come
to the Friday office hours and check out what's left, but the pickings
are usually slim.
