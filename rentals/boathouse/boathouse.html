<h2>Details of the rental procedure</h2>

<ol>

<li>Become a boathouse keyholder. To become a boathouse keyholder, MITOC members must complete boathouse training and then provide one hour of service to the boathouse once a year to maintain active keyholder status. Training sessions are held monthly, coordinated by the Boathouse Manager, and announced on the paddle listserv. If you became a keyholder last year, you can rent boats through May before renewing your keyholder training.</li>



<li>Get certified to rent out the boat you want. Whitewater kayaks, sea kayaks and windsurfers are all restricted gear; only canoes can be rented out by all keyholders. The best way to get certified is to go on a trip with the appropriate boat chair so that they can make sure you have the skills needed to use the boat safely. Otherwise, you can talk with them at keyholder training or by emailing the boathouse-mgr listserv.</li>



<li>For each trip that you want to use a seak kayak or take a canoe on a car, fill out a <a href ="http://web.mit.edu/mitoc/www/#activities/paddle/seakayaking.shtml">float plan form at the bottom of the sea kayak page</a>.</li>



<li>As early as possible, email the <a href="mailto:boathouse-mgr@mit.edu">boat chairs</a> with your reservation request and respond promptly to any of their concerns. Please try to email us a week in advance, and the deadline is noon Wednesday for an upcoming weekend. Allow us a couple days to respond since we are busy and do this on a volunteer basis. As with other MITOC gear, each member can rent gear only for himself and one other person. Boathouse keyholders may borrow more than two boats so long as there is at least one MITOC member in the group for every two boats rented. Official MITOC trips also take precedence over individual rentals, so check that there are no conflicting trips scheduled on the MITOC calendar. If your reservation is approved, the boat chair will tell you and authorize the MITOC office to rent you a key.</li>



<li>Go to the MITOC office hours (posted on the calendar) with your checkbook to rent the gear and get a set of boathouse keys when you rent the boat and gear from the database. You'll need to leave a large deposit check with the office for the keys, boat, life jackets, etc, but it will only be cashed in cases of negligent gear breakage or theft. </li>



<li>Get your boat and gear from the boathouse. There will be one key that will open the exterior doors to the loading dock, and the interior boat storage room doors. </li>



<li>Have a fun, safe trip! Respect the boats and don't let them get stolen. While you have posession of a key, you have 24-hour access to the boathouse. We ask that you return your boats to the boathouse when you get back to Cambridge instead of leaving them on your car overnight.</li>



<li>Return and clean your boat and gear at the boathouse. If the boats were used in salt water or got dirty, please rinse them off before returning them. There is a sponge and bucket available in the seakayaking room. Also, please try to brush off any sand on the exterior of the boats. Life jackets and skirts also should be returned dry and have any salt or sand rinsed off. </li>



<li>Return the key to the MITOC office and pay the rental fee, preferably by credit card. Cash is not accepted for any MITOC transactions. Once you pick up the key, you must return it within 7 days (or the next time the office is open). <strong>A late fee of 1 day per weekend will be charged if you do not return your keys on time.</strong> During busy summer weekends we sometimes run out of keys so please return them as soon as possible. </li>



<li>Email the <a href="mailto:boathouse-mgr@mit.edu">boat chairs</a> and tell them how your trip went, about any boat problems or damage.</li>



<li>Post a <a href = "http://web.mit.edu/mitoc/www/#tripreports">trip report</a> or put pics up in the <a href = "http://web.mit.edu/mitoc/www/#gallery">gallery</a>!</li>
