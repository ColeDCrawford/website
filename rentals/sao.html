<h1>SAO guidelines:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Reimbursement requests must be accompanied by a receipt as a proof of payment.
<li>If you lost the receipt, we also accept credit card statements (not prefered but doable), black out other transactions.
<li>Try to use credit or debit card, avoid cash if you can.
<li>They like it if your receipt/invoice has something like: VISA ************9023 on it somewhere (as it proves you paid for it).
<li>SAO doesn't let us pay for tax***, see below for details.
<li>Reimbursements expire after 10 weeks from purchase or service. We cannot reimburse anything older than 10 weeks.
</ul>

<h2>Sales tax is non-reimbursable</h2>
So make sure not to pay it.
Use the tax-exempt ID number for MIT: 04-2103594
If required, use the MA sales tax exempt form at : http://vpf.mit.edu/site/procurement/forms_and_templates
"There is also a list of MIT Tax exempt number for other states, available on procurements website."
<p>
If you are buying something online and they do not have a tax exempt option in the purchase order, you will need to email the customer service department of the company you are buying from after your purchase and provide them with the tax exempt information. They will then credit your account with the sales tax amount.  If they legally have to charge you sales tax (sometimes the case for out of state purchases, though not always: see the "procurements"website) then we can reimburse you for the sales tax. We cannot legally reimburse anyone for sales tax paid on purchases from companies operating in the state of Massachusetts.  This is being strictly enforced by the SAO. This blows, I know.
