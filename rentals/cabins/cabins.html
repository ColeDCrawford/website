MITOC has two cabins in New Hampshire, <a href = "#rentals/cabins/camelot/camelot.html">Camelot</a> and <a href = "#rentals/cabins/intervale/intervale.html">Intervale</a>. 

<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATES ON INTERVALE CABIN - TO USE INTERVALE, YOU MUST READ THE ENTIRE<a href="#rentals/cabins/intervale/intervale.html"> INTERVALE PAGE HERE</a> AND ABIDE BY THE POLICIES SET FORTH BY THE CABIN MANAGERS OR RISK LOSING YOUR INTERVALE USAGE PRIVILEDGES!</strong>
<h2> Who can use the cabin? </h2>
<ul>
<li>MITOC members with keyholder training can rent cabin keys from our office.
<li>All MITOC members can stay at the yurt (Intervale) or lean-to (Camelot), or camp on the property.
</ul>
<strong>You must always contact the cabin manager before staying at the cabin, or camping on MITOC property.</strong>

<h2> Who is a keyholder and how do I become one?</h2>

Keyholders are MITOC members who have attended a training session and work day at the cabin. 
Keyholder trainings are held a few times throughout the year and are announced on the MITOC list. 
You can also become a keyholder by helping a manager around the cabin. Managers will email 
<a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/cabin-helpers">cabin-helpers mailing list</a> 
whenever they need an extra hand. Be sure to add yourself on that mailing list if you're interested.

<h2>I'm not a keyholder, can I still stay at the cabin?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check the calendar to the left and see if there will be a keyholder staying at the cabin.
<li>Email the keyholder requesting if you can stay with them. Cc the cabin manager.
</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Can I just camp or stay at the yurt/lean-to?</h2>
Yes, if you are a MITOC member. Email the cabin manager asking if you can camp on the property or stay at the yurt/lean-to.

<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
<p>Consult the table below for cabin use costs. All rates are per day of use. To pay for cabin rental please head to the <a href="#office/paymitoc.shtml">Pay MITOC</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: Cabin fee is non-refundable.</strong></p>

<h2>How were the cabins built?</h2>
All the MITOC cabins were designed and built by student and alum labor.
You too can help in the upkeep, construction, and improvement of the cabins
if you want. Just contact a club Cabin Manager, and go to a Keyholder work day.

<H3>Keyholder Responsibilities</H3>
<P>This section assumes that you are acting as the keyholder for a large
group.  If you are the keyholder and a member of the group, or you are
visiting the cabin with just a few of your friends, the group dynamics
would obviously change a bit.</P>

<P>First of all, the keyholder is not responsible for the actions of the
group.  It is assumed that the keyholder will make a good faith effort
to instruct the group on safe usage of the cabin, and to warn them of
any dangerous or stupid activities.  If the keyholder holds up that
end of the bargain, and the group persists in unwise activities that
damage the cabin, then the group and its leaders, not the keyholder,
will be held responisble for damage.</P>

<P>Furthermore, it is not the responsibility of the keyholder to police
the actions of each and every member of the group.  At the beginning
of the trip, the keyholder should identify who is the leader of the
group.  If there are any problems with members of the group, and the
keyholder does not want to confront the individuals directly, the
keyholder should inform the group leader that members of the group are
behaving badly.  It is then up to the group leader to enforce proper
behavior.</P>

<P>When the keyholder first determines that a problem is occurring, he
should first inform the group members or leaders as to how to correct
the situation.  If that does not resolve the problem, the keyholder can
assess fines, to be deducted from the $1000 deposit check, and inform
the group leader that this will occur.  If any such problem occurs, the
keyholder should discuss the situation with the cabin manager as soon as
possible after returning to Boston.  As a last resort, the keyholder
has the authority to revoke the group's priviledge of using the cabin,
and to order them to leave.</P>

<h3>How to become a keyholder</h3>
<p>
It is very easy to become a keyholder,
and we encourage all the groups which might want to use the cabin to have
a member become one. In order to become a keyholder, one has to go on a
check-out trip to the cabin with the cabin manager. These check-out trips
are generally run once a term and involve a morning spent touring the cabin
and perhaps an afternoon spent doing some maintenance work. Contact the
<a href="/mitoc/www/info/officers.shtml">cabin managers</a> for information on the next keyholder checkout trip.</p>
