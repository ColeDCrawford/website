<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong>*IMPORTANT UPDATE*</strong>
<p>We have new neighbors to Intervale. They have purchased and built a new house with children and a dog. Our legal right of way crosses their property. We only have the right to cross their property on foot without specific authorization from the Cabin Managers. 
<ul>
  <li>There is to be no driving or parking on their property at any times for any reasons!</li>
  <li>Do not use the neighbors driveway for ANYTHING. Walk up the right of way path and not the neighbors driveway.</li>
  <li> If animals (such as dogs) are authorized to go to Intervale <strong>(must receive Cabin Manager approval first)</strong> they must remain on leash, at the owners side as they cross the neighbors property and are not to be allowed to roam the Intervale grounds unsupervised as this may result in animals being animals and unwanted interactions with the neighbors!</li>
  <li>There are to be no animals off leash or left to roam on their property!</li>
  <li>If you cannot carry it up to the cabin, you can't take it!</li>
  <li>You are to be quiet and curteous while crossing the neighbors property and remain on the right of way!</li>
  <li>Vehicles must remain at the designated parking lot and are not to be on the neighbors or any other property. <b>Note:</b> The far right two parking spots in the lot are to remain open as they are not ours.</li>
  <li>If you have any questions or concerns about any of these, please contact the Cabin Managers BEFORE you go to the cabin!</li>
  <li><strong><u><em>Violation of any of these policies may result in the revocation of your MITOC cabin priviledges!</em></u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cabin Managers can be contacted via email at <a href="mailto:intervale-mgr@mit.edu">intervale-mgr@mit.edu</a></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Get a map of New Hampshire and leave well before dark.
<br />- NH maps are free at the NH rest areas that
have facilities, such as the one right after the toll on Rt 93 N. The last part
of the trip is tricky if you've never been there before.
<br />- The trip from Cambridge can take between 2 to over 4 hours.<br />- Friday
afternoon/evening traffic can be heavy heading north most times of year.
<br />- In winter, skiers head north to the many ski
areas; in summer vacationers; fall, foliage viewers; in spring there is often
less traffic.
<br />- In the summer, find out
if there is a race going on at the New Hampshire speedway 
<a href="http://www.nhis.com/">http://www.nhis.com/</a>and plan accordingly if
taking Rt 93 because southbound Rt 93 will have a LOT of traffic when the races
get out, often on Sunday afternoons.
<br />- The town of North Conway is notorious for slow moving traffic all day
long especially weekends.<br />- There are
numerous outlet shops that attract swarms of people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can check traffic online before leaving at <a
href="http://www.boston.com/traffic">http://www.boston.com/traffic</a> or call
smartraveler from cell phones at *1-SEND (free call from verizon)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be prepared to pay NH tolls: ($0.75 - $2.00 depending on which way you go)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can purchase a roll of tokens for $5 at the first toll
you get to, which gives you a discount, it is worth it to get a roll, and use
them over the next few trips to NH.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Traditional directions route:</u></b><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From MIT take Rt 93 North to Exit 37 for RT 95 North, which
is also Rt 128 N</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Follow 95, careful to stay right on 95 as Rt 128 splits off
and stays straight/left. </p>

<p class=HTMLBody><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Shortly after entering New Hampshire there is a
$1.00 toll in Hampton.<br />- Take Exit 4 (a left exit) for Rt 16 North
following signs saying White Mountains and Spaulding turnpike.<br />- Parts of
16 here are toll, there are two more toll booths $.50 in Dover and then $0.50
in Rochester. A trailer is an additional $.25 per axle each toll.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Follow Rt 16 N for a long way, it begins as a divided
highway and becomes a two-way secondary road.<br />- When you see the puffin
Mobil station on the right at a stoplight, you are about half way.<br />- Once
you are in Conway, you'll notice more congestion of shops and lights.<br />-
Watch for the movie theater on the left among other shops, and if you wish to
avoid the North Conway traffic (if it is Sat or Sun 9am - 9pm do it!) follow
the detour below by taking West Side Road.<br />- Otherwise follow Rt 16 North,
which takes a left turn where Rt 302 goes straight into Fryeburg, Maine.<br />-
Rt 16 goes through the many shops and restaurants of North Conway.<br />- After
things get a bit less congested, watch for a Mt Washington view rest area on
the left (the closest pay phone to the cabin) and a small two store building
with a subway shop on the right.<br />- Soon after you go over train tracks
take a right onto Rt 16A </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Follow 16A about two miles and after a four way
intersection, with Town Hall Road, the next right is Dundee Road.<br />- If you
miss 16A take a right onto Town Hall road next right after the scarecrow pub,
the first left and then a right onto Dundee Road.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br />- Follow directions
below from Dundee Road.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Scenic route:<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good for summer and early fall for the nice views and scenic
pull offs great for picnicking and rest stops, but poor in winter because of
bad higher elevation mountain roads, in fact, Bear Notch Road is closed in
winter, and Rt 112 is treacherous and often not plowed quickly in storms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Take Rt 93 North (toll booth near Manchester NH is $0.75 or
three tokens) go about 125 miles from Boston to Exit 32 for Rt 112 (Kancamagus
Highway).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Turn left off the exit ramp.<br />- Go East on Rt 112
through the town of Lincoln where there are numerous shops, and restaurants.<br
/>- If you are low on fuel, fill up here, as the next ~45 minutes has no gas
stations or facilities.<br />- The McDonalds on the right is a good bathroom
stop, as you don't have to go past the counter to enter the restroom.<br />-
Pass the Loon Mountian ski area, and stay straight for the scenic route through
the mountains where there are MANY trailheads and parking areas to begin
hikes.<br />- After the Pasaconaway and Jigger Johnson campgrounds on the left,
watch for Bear Notch Road also on the left.<br />- Take this route only in good
weather, as Bear Notch Road is closed in winter.<br />- Follow Bear Notch road
past more trailheads and scenic views to its end at a stop sign and yellow
blinking light.<br />- Take a right onto Rt 302 East.<br />- Follow past
Attitash Ski area and by a few restaurants to a stop light with a small grocery
store, and gas station on the right.<br />- At this intersection Rt 16 N is on
the left.<br />- Stay straight where you will be on Rt 16 South.<br />- Watch
for Rt 16 A to turn off on the left.<br />- Take this left, and then the second
left onto Dundee Road.<br />- Follow directions below from Dundee Road.<br />-
If you miss 16A take a left onto Town
Hall road, then the first left (16A) and then a right onto Dundee Road.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Shorter distance, side roads route:<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This route is the shortest actual distance, cutting through
the lakes region, and often good to avoid holiday weekend traffic.<br />- (This has not been verified, directions
provided by a previous cabin manager)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Get on Route 93 North into New Hampshire to Exit 23 ( Rt
104, Merideth)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Take a right at the end of the Exit ramp, and go East on Rt
104 for 8.7 miles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the road comes to a T turn left on Rt 3 North, proceed
for 1 mile Turn right onto Rt 25 East and proceed for ~23 miles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the road comes to a T, turn left onto Rt 16 North.<br />- Follow 16 N to Conway, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>WEST SIDE ROAD DETOUR (in Conway):<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just past the movie theater (small, one screen cinema) to
the next traffic light, take a left onto WASHINGTON street.<br />- There is a
sign on the left for a business with the name ECHO on it at this intersection,
and signs for Eaton to the right.<br />- Washington street/</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>West Side Road<b> </b>will lead you to avoid the strip mall
and traffic of North Conway.<br />- If you
prefer to check out the shops/restaurants and go shopping stay straight and
follow signs for Rt 16 North.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once on Washington street, stay left at the fork in the
road, and you are then on West Side Road. Follow this past Echo lake state park
on the left, and until you come to a stop sign at a T in the road.<br />- You
can then take a right then left to join up with Rt 16 North again, or follow
West Side Road further by taking a left, which further avoids traffic, but is a
bit of back tracking at the end.<br />- West side road continues past another
entrance to Echo lake state park, Cathedral ledge, and Diana's baths on the
left and a decent spot to swim in the Saco river on the right.<br />- West Side
Road ends at a T with a stop sign, where you should take a sharp right onto Rt
302.<br />- Follow to a stop light intersections with Rt 16 there is a small
grocery store, and gas station on the right.<br />- Take this left, and then
the second left onto Dundee Road.<br />- Follow directions below from Dundee
Road.<br />- If you miss 16A take a left onto Town Hall road, the first left
and then a right onto Dundee Road.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Once you are on Dundee Road,</u></b> drive about a
hundred yards until you see a cleared gravel area on your left.<br />- There
may or may not be a sign indicating MITOC parking there.<br />-  There is also
a small Dundee Ski Club lodge just off this parking lot.<br />- Do not park
anywhere else but here, not even to unload gear.<br />- If you attempt to drive
the rest of the way, you may annoy our neighbors, with whom we'd like to
stay on good terms.</p>

<b>

<p>Please keep in mind that this parking lot is owned by the Dundee Ski Club.  MITOC has been granted permission to park here under two conditions.  

<p>1. That MITOC leave enough space such that the Dundee Ski Club can park two cars side-by-side in the lot
<p>2. That MITOC not block the driveway of the Dundee Ski Club.  </b>




<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Continue on foot up the <u>paved</u> road, passing a few
dirt driveways on the left.<br />- Watch for a multi-level wood retaining wall
high on the right side, ours is the second driveway on the left after that
wall.<br />- Look for a mailbox with the #61 Dundee Road at this driveway this
is about at the top of the first rise in the road.<br />- Enter this driveway,
which has a yellow house on the right and further in, a yellow trailer.<br />-
To the left of the trailer you will see the mitoc signs indicating that it is a
footpath only.<br />- Please take care not to shine flashlights at the
neighbor's house or trailer.<br />- Respect the privacy of the neighbors,
and try to avoid entering and leaving between the hours of midnight and 6
AM.<br />- The trail from there should be quite obvious and wide; it turns
right past the trailer and up the hill.<br />- At the top of the hill you will
first find a nice deck on the left side, on top of the old cabin foundation, an
outhouse off a trail on the right, fire ring on the left, and the yurt and
cabin further uphill toward the right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you stray far at all in any direction you will
unwittingly stray off MITOC property.<br />- Please stay near the cabin (within
300' or so), as we only own the top of the hill, and not the surrounding
land.<br />- Respect others property, have a good time and use the checklist
when arriving, cleaning and closing up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>If
you have any updates or feedback on these directions, please contact the cabin manager
above.</span></p>
