<p><strong>*IMPORTANT UPDATE*</strong>
<p>We have new neighbors to Intervale. They have purchased and built a new house with children and a dog. Our legal right of way crosses their property. We only have the right to cross their property on foot without specific authorization from the Cabin Managers. 
<ul>
  <li>There is to be no driving or parking on their property at any times for any reasons!</li>
  <li>Do not use the neighbors driveway for ANYTHING. Walk up the right of way path and not the neighbors driveway.</li>
  <li> If animals (such as dogs) are authorized to go to Intervale <strong>(must receive Cabin Manager approval first)</strong> they must remain on leash, at the owners side as they cross the neighbors property and are not to be allowed to roam the Intervale grounds unsupervised as this may result in animals being animals and unwanted interactions with the neighbors!</li>
  <li>There are to be no animals off leash or left to roam on their property!</li>
  <li>If you cannot carry it up to the cabin, you can't take it!</li>
  <li>You are to be quiet and curteous while crossing the neighbors property and remain on the right of way!</li>
  <li>Vehicles must remain at the designated parking lot and are not to be on the neighbors or any other property. <b>Note:</b> The far right two parking spots in the lot are to remain open as they are not ours.</li>
  <li>If you have any questions or concerns about any of these, please contact the Cabin Managers BEFORE you go to the cabin!</li>
  <li><strong><u><em>Violation of any of these policies may result in the revocation of your MITOC cabin priviledges!</em></u></strong></li>
  </ul>
<p>Cabin Managers can be contacted via email at <a href="mailto:intervale-mgr@mit.edu">intervale-mgr@mit.edu</a></p>
<p>On to the fun stuff! :)</p>
<p>Intervale is a rustic cabin located near North Conway, NH off Rt. 16. 
  It is about a 3 hour drive from Boston, and
  located in the middle of some of New Hampshire's best hiking and skiing
  areas. 
  
<h2>Nearby Area</h2>

Intervale is about a 15-minute drive from rock climbing at Cathedral Ledge
or White Horse Ledge, or swimming at Echo Lake. Many trailheads are within
a half-hour's drive, including the Presidentials and Mt. Washington, Mt.
Kearsarge North, and Arethusa Falls (the tallest and most spectacular in
the state). Downhill skiing is available at Attitash, 5 minutes away; Cranmore,
15 minutes away; and Wildcat, 20 minutes away.

<h2>What's at Intervale</h2>
Intervale is our newest cabin and is modern and well insulated. However,
it has no electricity or running water, and users will have to bring all
their own drinking water with them or use a spring near the cabin. There
is a carpeted sleeping loft that will fit about 12 people. We recommend bringing a sleeping pad and sleeping bag. There is plenty
of camping space outside. Intervale has a LP gas stove and heater, cooking
pans and utensils. There is also a dining table and plates and cutlery
for about 10 people.

<h2>The Yurt</h2>
<p>In addition to the beautiful new cabin at Intervale (built in 1994-95)
we also have our version of a traditional Mongolian dwelling called a Yurt,
constructed in 1993 by a diverse team of MITOC folks led by the illustrious
Dave Maltz.</P>

<P>It is a somewhat cylindrical single-room structure with a conical roof.
Instead of the traditional Yak hides (difficult to obtain in New Hampshire)
we used tar paper. </P>

<P>The Yurt serves as extra sleeping space at Intervale, and a unique
alternative to Western-style cabins. </P>
