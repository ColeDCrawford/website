The Camelot Cabin is a rustic located near Rumney and Plymouth, NH, and can accomodate upwards of 30 to 40 people. It is about a 2.5 hour drive from Boston and about 40 min from the alpine ski areas of Loon Mtn and Waterville Valley, hiking on Mounts Mousilake, Lincoln and Liberty, scenic vistas at the Flume and Cannon Cliff, or nordic skiing along the Kancamagus Highway. It's just 15 min away from world-famous sport climbing at Rumney Cliffs.</p>
<h2>What's at Camelot</h2>
<p>The cabin has complete cooking facilities and electricity, but no water and users will have to bring all their own water with them. <a href="#rentals/cabins/camelot/inventory.html"><span class="s1">Here</span></a> is a list of what you can expect to find at Camelot, including cookingware and old sleeping bags. The padded loft sleeps about twenty people, and there some couches which could support a couple of others. There is plenty of camping space outside.</p>

<h2>General guidelines</h2>
<h3>Fires</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Campfires are allowed only in the fire ring in front of the cabin</li>

  <li>NO BONFIRES, NO ACCELERANTS</li>
