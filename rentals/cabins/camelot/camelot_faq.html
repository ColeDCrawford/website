<h3>I am a keyholder and am familiar with the cabin; is it available this weekend?</h3>
Check the calendar (to your left) before emailing the cabin manager.
<h3>I am not a keyholder, but I am a MITOC member, can I camp on the premises?</h3>
Yes, you may camp on the property, but you have to get permission from the cabin manager first.
<h3>I want to become a keyholder when is the next training weekend?</h3>
There are usually at least two training weekends per year: one in the spring and another in the fall.  Additional weekends may also be announced.  All announcements will be sent at least a week in advance to the main mitoc list.
<h3>I attended a training weekend three years ago, can I stay at the cabin?</h3>
No, keyholder status expires after two years.  You will need to attend another work weekend to renew.
<h3>I've heard of MITOC but am not a member, can I stay anyway?</h3>
No, you would be trespassing on private property (we have had people arrested for this in the past).  There must be a MITOC member in your group if you wish to visit the property.
<h3>My group wants to make an exclusive reservation but we don't have a keyholder... how do we start?</h3>
Find a keyholder first and then contact the cabin manager about your reservation.</li>

<h3>What firewood can I use?</h3>
The wood in the shed is for stove use only; do not burn it in the fire-pit.  Campfires may be made using the wood under the front of the cabin, or dead branches that you find on the ground.
<h3>How do I dispose of ashes from the wood stove or the firepit?</h3>
Ashes should be buried underground, or dumped into the outhouse pit.  Do not scatter them, do not bury them in a snow bank and do not pull out logs that are only partially burnt.  Use a metal bucket and a short shovel from the back porch to transport them.
<h3>How does the water system work?</h3>
Water is pumped up from a barrel near the stream.  It is kept under pressure in a storage tank.  Three sediment  filters are located under the cabin and a UV filter is located next to the sink.  
The water from the faucet is not potable, the water from the UV filter may be consumed at your own risk.  The pump is not designed to run continuously, and the low stream level can not refill the barrel quickly.  
Should the barrel empty and the pump lose its prime, the water system will become inoperable and the pump should be switched off immediately. 
<h3>Can I use Clivus?</h3>
Usage is seasonal.  It is generally closed in the summer and open for use in the winter.  Look for a sign across the bathroom door and an indication on the whiteboard.
