<h3>I am a keyholder and am familiar with the cabin; is it available this weekend?</h3>
Check the calendar (to your left) before emailing the cabin manager.
<h3>I am not a keyholder, but I am a MITOC member, can I camp on the premises?</h3>
Yes, you may camp on the property, but you have to get permission from the cabin manager first.
<h3>I want to become a keyholder when is the next training weekend?</h3>
There are usually at least two training weekends per year: one in the spring and another in the fall.  Additional weekends may also be announced.  All announcements will be sent at least a week in advance to the main mitoc list.
<h3>I attended a training weekend three years ago, can I stay at the cabin?</h3>
No, keyholder status expires after two years.  You will need to attend another work weekend to renew.
<h3>I've heard of MITOC but am not a member, can I stay anyway?</h3>
No, you would be trespassing on private property (we have had people arrested for this in the past).  There must be a MITOC member in your group if you wish to visit the property.
<h3>My group wants to make an exclusive reservation but we don't have a keyholder... how do we start?</h3>
Find a keyholder first and then contact the cabin manager about your reservation.</li>
