<p>
We offer the MITOC cabins for rent by groups for retreats/events. Reserving an exclusive rental gives your group exclusive access to the cabin for the days you rent.
This means no other parties may stay at the cabin or property during your stay.
<p>
The exclusive rental rate for Camelot is $300, and Intervale $250 per night.
You must bring your exclusive reservation fee check (and cabin security deposit of $1000)
to office hours in order to reserve the cabin. First come first serve.
We cannot guarantee exclusive rental until we have your checks (not the case for non exclusive rentals).
The keyholder may cancel the reservation no later than 7 days before the reservation date without penalty.
Less than 7 days and we will cash the exclusive reservation fee check. No exceptions!

<h2>How were the cabins built?</h2>
All the MITOC cabins were designed and built by student and alum labor.
You too can help in the upkeep, construction, and improvement of the cabins
if you want. Just contact a club Cabin Manager, and go to a Keyholder work day.

<H3>Keyholder Responsibilities</H3>
<P>This section assumes that you are acting as the keyholder for a large
group.  If you are the keyholder and a member of the group, or you are
visiting the cabin with just a few of your friends, the group dynamics
would obviously change a bit.</P>

<P>First of all, the keyholder is not responsible for the actions of the
group.  It is assumed that the keyholder will make a good faith effort
to instruct the group on safe usage of the cabin, and to warn them of
any dangerous or stupid activities.  If the keyholder holds up that
end of the bargain, and the group persists in unwise activities that
damage the cabin, then the group and its leaders, not the keyholder,
will be held responisble for damage.</P>

<P>Furthermore, it is not the responsibility of the keyholder to police
the actions of each and every member of the group.  At the beginning
of the trip, the keyholder should identify who is the leader of the
group.  If there are any problems with members of the group, and the
keyholder does not want to confront the individuals directly, the
keyholder should inform the group leader that members of the group are
behaving badly.  It is then up to the group leader to enforce proper
behavior.</P>

<P>When the keyholder first determines that a problem is occurring, he
should first inform the group members or leaders as to how to correct
the situation.  If that does not resolve the problem, the keyholder can
assess fines, to be deducted from the $1000 deposit check, and inform
the group leader that this will occur.  If any such problem occurs, the
keyholder should discuss the situation with the cabin manager as soon as
possible after returning to Boston.  As a last resort, the keyholder
has the authority to revoke the group's priviledge of using the cabin,
and to order them to leave.</P>

<h3>How to become a keyholder</h3>
<p>
It is very easy to become a keyholder,
and we encourage all the groups which might want to use the cabin to have
a member become one. In order to become a keyholder, one has to go on a
check-out trip to the cabin with the cabin manager. These check-out trips
are generally run once a term and involve a morning spent touring the cabin
and perhaps an afternoon spent doing some maintenance work. Contact the
<a href="/info/officers.shtml">cabin managers</a> for information on the next keyholder checkout trip.</p>
