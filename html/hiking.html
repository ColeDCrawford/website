  <h2>3 SEASON HIKING</h2>

    Hiking, camping, and backpacking, whichever it is that you like, you still need a good place to do it. Most MITOC members hike up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire whenever the opportunity arises. Of course, some good hiking grounds do exist much closer to Boston. For a brief description of what is available, see our short hiking guide. There is also a good Boston hiking guide available offsite.

    MITOC stocks an extensive supply of hiking and camping equipment, pretty much everything you may need with the exception of clothing and flashlights. For rental rates on tents, sleeping bags, stoves, backpack, etc see the up-to-date rental list

    If you would like to go on one of the club trips you should join one of the mailing lists (some of the bigger trips are advertised on the sidebar. The club generally runs half a dozen large trips that involve hiking, including two circuses, winter school, and an annual trip to Acadia. In addition, smaller trips led by individual members take place every weekend.
