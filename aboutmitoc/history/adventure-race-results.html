The Acadia trip and Adventure Race both worked out great!  The weather
held out for most of the time we were there, and we had a great time
hiking, biking, climbing, canoeing, and sea kayaking.  If you went on 
the trip and want to write a 
<a href="history/tripreports/tripreports.html">trip report</a>,
just email it to <sub><img src="../mitocmainlist.jpg"></sub> and we'll put it up on the web page.

<p>The Adventure Race winners are:
<ol>
<li><b>The Granite Landslide Maelstrom</b>: Andre Girerd, Christine
Kornylak, and Luke Sosnowski
<li><b>Two Girls, a Guy, and a Compass</b>: Veronique Bugnion, Jessica Neu,
and Scott Fitzgerald
<li><b>Bill's Team</b>: Bill Finger, Millie Rinard, and Brian Bingham
</ol>
All the competing teams deserve to be commended for finishing the race.

<h2>What is MITOC?</h2>
The MIT Outing Club (MITOC) is a group dedicated to the pursuit of outdoor
recreation. The group is comprised of students, staff, alumni, and faculty
from MIT, Wellesley, Lincoln and Draper Labs. The outing club provides
a forum for members to meet one another and to pursue outdoor trips. The
club organizes several trips throughout the year to various spots such
as the White Mountains and Acadia National Park in Maine. We have members
interested in activities such as hiking, biking, climbing, canoeing, whitewater
kayaking, sea kayaking, backpacking, skiing, and camping. In addition to
our trips the Outing Club owns two cabins in New Hampshire for use by members
and also has a large quantity of outdoor equipment for rent.
