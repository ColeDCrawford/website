and more important, things learned and suggested for future 4 of july trips:

- food and munchies was good to bring (Thanks for all the people who brought)
- in my personal opinion a small radio might have been good, since at 
times it was hard to listen to the music (although not truly a necessity)
- An ANCHOR would have been a relly good idea to have been carried on a canoe
because many times we used the services of chris "tug boat" barret to align
and reposition the flotilla.
- finally for those taking out kayaks, a small piece of wood (2 feet) somewhat
flat, would be nice to carry to be used as back support, I used a canoe
paddle and it was a plus.  (a more properly designed or fitted device though,
would have increase greatly the comfort level).

just my four american pennies,

> Trip Report:  Charles River Flotilla
> -------------------------------------
> 
> 	To celebrate the 4th of July in true MITOC style, the entire
> plastic and aluminum fleet was launched into the mighty Charles last
> Saturday evening.  There were nearly 30 of us in all, with Bill
> Finger serving as shepherd and head zoo-keeper.  We took everything
> that looked like it would float, and a few things that looked like
> they just might.
> 
> 	Since the lower part of the river basin ends up quite densely
> packed with boats of all shapes and sizes (and sea-worthiness!), and
> hence maneuverability is limited, we waited until just before the
> Pops took to the stage for put in.  By this time everyone had dropped
> anchor, and the hazards are greatly reduced for canoes and kayaks
> (a very good idea for future trips).
> 
> 	Unfortunately, the shorelines were even more densely packed
> than the water and Mem Drive and Mass Ave were closed, leaving us
> little choice but a hearty portage from the boathouse behind the MIT
> museum to the sailing pavilion.  Little problem for Hector 'macho
> man' Briceno of course, who shouldered 2 boats with ease (he would
> have carried 4, but he wanted to jog backwards).
> 
> 	Setting off from the sailing pavilion, we made our way across
> the river towards the Esplanade just as the music started, though
> with that many boats anchored, one could almost walk across!  It
> Should be noted that this is perhaps not the most flattering view of
> the Charles River, and another good reason to wait for sunset.  The
> Basin under these conditions can best be described as flatwater, with
> class III exhaust fumes.  Perhaps the most disturbing sight was the
> Barbecues hanging from the stern of many of the power boats- while
> reputed to contain some water, the river still seemed to close to
> open flame for our comfort.
> 
> 	Many in the group were foreigners (author incl!), and many
> others had never seen a Boston Independence Day before, so the sheer
> spectacle of it all was impressive in itself; The Esplanade was
> absolutely packed, and the immense sound system reverb'd the Pops
> down both shorelines to the Harvard Bridge.  We sung the Anthem with
> gusto, if not with complete lyrics.
> 
> 	We entered the narrow channel between the shore and the
> island, and slowly made our way up to the source at the Hatch Shell.
> In the twilight the scene was an eerie one, with all of the little
> footbridges draped with legs that dangled like stubby vines, and the
> grass on either side completely covered by a sea of sprawling
> endomorphs.  We pressed on towards the source of the noise,
> paddling deeper and deeper into the heart of an immense darkness.
> 
> 	This certainly afforded one of the closest approaches, as we
> could nestle up against the shore right beside the shell, and the
> narrowness of the channel precluded all but the smallest of boats like 
> ourselves.  Lying that low in the water however, we couldn't really see
> much of the action, so we retreated back up the channel to the first
> Big Screen to watch the remainder of the performance, and to practice
> our kayak salsa dancing in the open areas to some of the swing numbers.
> 
> 	This part of the channel had the bonus of a fountain too, and
> the English canoeing contingent amused us by selectively showering
> just the center of their canoe.  This was not quite as amusing for
> poor Helen however, for this was where she was sitting.  About time
> our Trip Whip became the Whippee instead of the Whipper...
> 
> 	Nearing the end of the concert, we made our way back out the
> channel & across the Basin (Trip Note: another very good idea, while
> all of the big boats were still moored) for the Fireworks.  It was
> quite dark by this point, so we all donned our flashlights and 
> headlamps, which should be considered necessary equipment.  Water
> bottles should be brought too, for that matter, since Independence
> Day was most certainly being celebrated in style by the vendors
> pursuing the American Dream of selling water for 3 bucks a bottle.
> (home of the brave perhaps, but land of the free?!)
> 
> 	The Cambridge side of the Charles was a fantastic place to
> watch the 'bombs bursting in air' as it were, as since they were
> launched from a barge in the center of the river, we really couldn't
> get much closer (Trip note: stay UPwind).  We could *feel* the bigger
> ones as much as see them, and the brilliant reflections from both
> the water and the glass buildings in Boston were almost as
> spectacular as the view overhead.
> 
> 	Again, we had a long carry back to the boathouse (though
> nothing a true MITOCer couldn't handle), and intrepid voyageurs
> Bill and Jenn even forged an indoor route to Mass Ave through the
> 'infinite portage'.
> 
> 	Sore shoulders were promptly soothed over pints at the Field
> in Central Square- God Bless America!!
