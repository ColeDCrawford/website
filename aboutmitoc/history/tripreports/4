	On the morning of Sunday, 26 January 1997, Scott, Chris, Lisa, Beau,
Areg, Sasha, Joe, and James exited their warm sleeping bags in Camelot to 
head north for Franconia Notch.
	As the goal for the day was for us to see some air below our feet, 
we headed up the old bridle path that leads from Franconia Notch, past the
Greenleaf Hut, and to the summit of Lafayette.
	The air was clear, the sun was out, and the temperatures stayed in the
low single digits.  Because of the hard snow, we stopped to strap on crampons 
early in our climb up the ridge, when we we were still deep in the trees.  We
had snowshoes in the cars, and wisely left them there; the trail was well
packed.
	We reached Greenleaf before 2pm, and took a drink, had a bite to eat, 
and pulled out our hardcore wind gear for the summit cone.
	Perhaps it was the distraction of looking at the Green Mountains in 
Vermont, or looking far down onto the top of Cannon, or seeing I-93 as a double
wavy line going down the valley, but the climb up to the summit didn't seem to 
take very long.  Or maybe it was because, on Lafayette particularly, the summit
seems to be always just behind that next jumble of rocks, and then the next, 
and then the next...
	Because we summited late, around 3pm, and the wind was blowing hard
enough to knock me over, we cut short our stay on top.  I think I actually
said to someone, "See the one with the buildings? That's Mt. Washington.  Now
get back down the mountain."
	As we were dropping down the ridge, back in the trees, we found much to
our distress the snow was too hard for efficient butt-sliding or boot skiing.
	And of course with packed trails in deep snow, it is quite easy to hike
on in the dark without turning on our lights.  It was a Mitoc trip, right?  And
they always come back after dark.
