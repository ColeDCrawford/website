Subject: Cross Country Ski Report

Jen, Barrett, Matt, Janis, Martha and I met at the student center in the
midst of heavy rains at 7:30 on Saturday morning. After some discussion as
to how miserable the weather was going to be in the southern White Mountains
we pilled in the cars and set off. After 2.5 hours of driving on icy roads
(I've decided that NH just doesn't do a good job of keeping their roads
clear of ice) we arrived at the trailhead for Greely Ponds. A short stop at
the I-93 / NH 49 Chamber of Commerce yielded some maps of the ski trails
which turned out to be totally useless. 

We strapped on the ski in a light mist, consulted the map and set off on the
first wrong trail of the day. We ended up taking a "most difficult" trail
and ending up on the adjacent Waterville Valley ski trails (which you are
supposed to pay for). At this point it started raining and we turned around
to find another trail. Congratulations to the group, which included several
people who hadn't skied before on the decent, which was the most difficult
of the day. Jen broke a ski pole, which Barrett (being the good MIT
engineer) managed to replace using a downed stick. The weather also let up
and would hold for the rest of the day.

We then set off on the correct trail to Greely Ponds but were soon off
course due to the poor maps that we had.  (We had three separate maps of the
area and none were correct! I can't wait for the USGS to start reissuing
their maps). This time we enjoyed a good ascent up a "more difficult" trail
and turned around after a couple of hours of travel. Back down at the
bottom, we figured out where we had gone wrong and then proceeded to Greely
Pond, which was very beautiful. A long easy, grade downhill led us back to
the cars just before the sun disappeared. An easy drive back to Boston with
a long stop at a diner completed the trip.

The total distance was about 12 miles and everyone seemed to enjoy
themselves. This area has numerous well-defined ski trails for exploring and
I hope to return soon. THe parking area is located at the end of Tripoli
Road in Waterville Valley off NH 49 and I-93, just north of Plymouth. I
picked up some extra trail descriptions from the Forest Service which give
precise directions to all their trail heads and will put them in the MITOC
office.
