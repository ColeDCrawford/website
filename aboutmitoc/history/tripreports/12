Subject: Trip Report: Lonesome Lake

Our group of seven people, Paul, Matthew, Pat, Bill, Christine, and the trip 
leaders Jesse and Jim, met early Saturday morning for our overnight trip to 
Lonesome Lake in the Franconia Notch area.  Despite the steady drizzle in 
Boston, there was plenty of snow in New Hampshire.  Our hike to the lake from 
the parking lot with loaded packs took approximately an hour.  Snow shoes were 
not necessary for the well-packed trail, but they were at times useful to keep 
from slipping on the inclines.  Our reward after the upward toil was a blue 
sky, warm weather, and an entire lake of snow to play on.  The snow conditions 
were perfect for packing snowballs.  We set up our tents on the western shore 
of the lake and enjoyed the sight of the setting sun on Franconia Ridge as we 
cooked our dinner.  By 6:30, we were finished with dinner and the stars were 
out in abundance.  It was a clear evening.  A group of us went on a short 
excursion further up the trail to Kinsman Pond.  It took us two hours and 
fifteen minutes to get up there, but one hour less coming down..... probably 
because we sat on the trail and slid down much of the time.  The Fishin' Jimmy 
Trail that we took to the pond was very packed down, and the pond itself 
appeared to be frozen.  However, since we heard noises from the ice shifting 
and we couldn't see far into the increasingly foggy night, we didn't venture 
out onto the ice.  By the time we got back down to the tents, the wind had 
picked up and the temperature had dropped.  The wind howled from the north all 
night.  The next morning, the snow on the pond had a hard crust, and the trees 
were covered in powder.  We made a quick breakfast, packed up camp, and headed 
for the parking lot, only stopping briefly to admire the snowman built by the
outing club from Brown University.  Our hike down took only twenty-five 
minutes.  We all enjoyed the trip immensely.  The beautiful weather on Saturday
and the cold conditions on Sunday made our camping experience the ideal mix of 
pleasure and education.  Thanks to Jesse and Jim for leading the outing.
