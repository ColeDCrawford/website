Subject: Trip Report -- Indian Head

This trip was on the light side.  I started at 11am on Sunday with 5
friends -- some of whom really wanted to go slowly.  Those who did not own
snowshoes had rented them at "Ski Fanatics" because this trip wasn't
planned until Saturday night.  (Ski Fanatics is a store and rental outfit
at the Waterville Valley exit on 93.  Their rentals can stay out until 6pm,
which is much better than the Waterville Valley nordic center at 4:15.)
Everybody's snowshoes seemed to fit, and we had several brands represented
so I was looking forward to comparing them.  We started up the Indian Head
Trail, which is rated a III but hardly deserves it.  We were probably the
first group through since the ice storm judging by the lack of tracks.  We
were glad since some of us had just paid $12 for snowshoe rentals.  The
weather could not have been better.  It was sunny and in the high 30's.  My
poorly-outfitted friends did okay in sweat pants and duck boots.  We
reached the top and ate a big lunch at the top of the cliffs.  It's not a
very high point, but the views are exceptional.  We found a friend's tracks
coming up from the other trailhead at the Flume.  He must have gotten there
hours earlier and headed off-trail to the West for higher ground.  Having
parked one car at the Flume we headed down the Mt Pemigewasset trail, which
seemed to be poorly marked.  There were tracks all through the woods, but
they all converged at the underpass under 93 at the bottom.  I have Tubbs
snowshoes and I broke them when I jumped off a big log and dropped about 8
feet and landed on one of the tails that had flopped forwards.  I can
hardly blame the snowshoes.  Someone else had "Sherpa" brand with a cutout
at the back inner "corner" so that you wouldn't step on your tails as much.
They seemed to be problematic because the cutout reduced surface area
under one side of the snowshoe and it would sink deeper.  Most of the
snowshoes, including mine, had flexible toe cords (allowing the thing to
flop freely under the ball of your foot).  This was an advantage in normal
walking, but a liability when running downslope or leaping across gullies.
Then they would flop forwards and you'd land wrong and potentially damage
something or fall on your face.  Once I get mine fixed I am going to look
into a "leash" or restraint of some kind to keep them from flopping more
than 90 degrees or so.
