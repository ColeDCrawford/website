Well, if you went then you already know that this Circus was a great 
success.  Weather and foliage cooperated admirably to create some
of the best hiking conditions in recent history.  
Friday night New Hampshire showed us  a beautiful display of 
northern lights.  At the cabin a happy camp fire greeted the weary 
travelers.
Saturday morning the trips got off without a hitch, except that 
we ran out of bagels at breakfast.  Dispatched Cathy to get more
for Sunday.  
Day mostly spent climibing up rocky trails and discovering what 
a "moderate" hike really is.  
Another camp fire in the evening, this time with a song book. And
two guitars.  Great singing by a troupe from Wellesley.
Ran out of bagels Sunday morning again - slack picked up by oatmeal.
Sunday hikes were much shorter - and the weather still cooperated.
The group that went to Mt. Kearsage (sp?) reported NO WIND AT ALL
at the rather exposed top.  
Everyone except a few die-hards left by Sunday night.  Got stuck 
in the traffic on either the Kancamangas Hwy. or in Conway, and 
took the time to go eat out.

Many thanks to all the leaders and co-leaders:

Jim
Jesse
Martin

(hope I did not forget anyone)

Without your this whole trip would not have been possible.  

As for everyone else, thanks for attending and enduring the 
long marches and long food lines with little complaint :)
In any case, I hope everyone enjoyed Circus.  The next big 
organized MITOC event is winter school, running all January.

Luke

PS.  If you have one of the MITOC med kits, please drop it
off at the MITOC office sometime this week.
