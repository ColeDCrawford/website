We had planned to climb on Saturday, but given the weather report I decided to 
postpone in advance so I wouldn't have to wake up early and admire the drizzle. 
Sunday I woke to a beautiful moon shining through a wonderfully clear sky, so 
at 8:15am Boris, Stephanie, Cyrus, Bryan, Bob, Alice, Steve, Cathy, and I left 
the mitoc office for Quincy Quarries. The quarries are excellent for winter 
climbing because, unlike most rock climbing, they're below the surrounding 
ground and so sheltered from the wind. C wall, where we climbed, faces south 
and gets the sun. It was a beautiful clear day so the sun had the rock actually 
_warm_ before noon, despite the estimated 35 degree air. We set up five ropes, 
moving a few of them during the course of the day to chase the sun, so there 
was a nice selection of climbs-- from easier ones I could attempt one-handed 
(I'm not supposed to be climbing at all because of a hand injury) to a harder 
one that stumped Steve. We started with a belaying clinic for the less 
experienced climbers and an inspiring climbing demonstration by Alice. Then 
everyone broke off into twos and threes to commune with the rock. Throughout 
the day, the ice on the water behind us cracked in impressive tones and fun 
seemed to be had by all. Stephanie tried variations on the flake, Boris 
downclimbed everything, Cathy climbed in plastic boots and looked comfortable 
napping in the sun, and Bob and Alice surprised many with the tiny m&m's in 
their gorp. As the sun began to disappear over the far edge of the quarry s
hortly after 3,  Boris, Cyrus, Bryan, and Stephanie were still going strong. We 
got back to the mitoc office at 4, faces reddened by the sun and cold. 
Thanks very much to Steve, Cathy, and Bob for their help.
