Despite the nasty (read:  way too warm for winter) weather predictions,
three of us took up snowshoes and winter camping gear, hoping to find a
great hike.  We took 93 straight up the W side of the Whites, then took 3,
checking things out near Bretton Woods, etc. We were utterly disappointed
by the complete lack of snow, but noticed that Franconia Notch still had
some decent looking snow.  So we headed back, arriving at Lafayette
[Seasonal Car-Camping Paradise] Campground about 11.30pm Fri.  We snowshoed
around for an hour or so under the light of the full moon (and Petzl now
and again), then pitched tents near a small snow pyramid.  Turns out the
pyramid was the snow piled atop a picnic table, so we were about 2.5' off
the ground.  Had a great night, with minimal melting even though the temp
hovered around 35F.

We settled in to bed about 2am and arose at 7am, breaking camp and heading
up Lonesome Lake trail about 8am.  On trail, the snow was fairly packed but
still required shoes to avoid post-holing.  Off trail, even with good broad
shoes, we were dropping about 1'.  The trail is moderately steep and
enjoyable, around 1.5 mi from trailhead to the lake which was still mostly
covered with a blanket of snow.  Although the snow was sticky (temp hovered
around 39F all day) and it was periodically tough to get adequate
flotation, it was a great ride.  In retrospect, we should have camped in
the flats just before you reach the lake--plenty of beautiful
winter-camping spots up there, and absolutely gorgeous.  We were incautious
at times and shoed over trees (the branches keep the snow from being
horribly dense, and we fell sometimes 2.5' thru the snow), but long live
goretex we were dry.

At the Lake (after schlepping around the periphery in the dense fog) we
took the trail uphill toward Mt. Cannon, which was a bit steeper but still
a blast.  We found that in warm weather like that, especially adding the
2.5' to our height, we were getting amazing amounts of water shed on us by
the branches of the trees overhanging the trail.  Our shells were drenched.
We kept up about a mile or so until a little trail sign said Hi-Cannon
trail to the Right.  We went left straight up a little summit nearby since
we were running out of time.  We climbed some beatifully steep stuff (even
a cornice) and found adjustable length (Leki) poles to be a godsend.  When
the fog cleared, the view of nearby mtns was absolutely breathtaking from
the little summit, but we only got a couple glimpses thru the thick,
wind-driven mist.  We stayed just below tree line and were sheltered from
the wicked fast winds (and the trees are a lot more breathable than
goretex).  We then hustled back down ("telemarking" on our shoes in
places), made some ramen on the stove and headed back, flying down the trail.

Lessons:  in those conditions we made just under 1mph uphill and 1.75 down.
 40F is too freaking hot to push yourself in winter conditions (i was
stripped down to regular old boxer shorts and my goretex).  The snow at
Franconia is definitely good for another 3 wks or so, and Lonesome lake and
connecting trails are still super for snowshoeing.  Xcountry skiing looked
crappy.

Gear comment:  I was using atlas summit 33, and they maneuver
fantastically.  the bindings are a dream, and the cleats are solid (we
climbed a 60-70-degree baby hill with ice for testing).  the paint job
sucks (gets scraped off easily).  the decking shed the wet snow pretty
well, but not perfectly, and the flotation (190lbs + 40lbs gear) was pretty
good altho not perfect.
