Sandwich Mtn, January 8, 2000
------------------------------

Hikers: Pat, Arrin, Ella, Carolyn, Sophia, Karen

Our small group of six had ideal conditions for a short, introductory 
winter hike on Sandwich Mtn.  The recent warm temperatures and lack of 
precipitation in Boston combined with my poor memory of the Sandwich Mtn. 
Trail had me expecting a dry-trail, cold-weather hike up to either Noon 
Peak or Jennings Peak (but not all the way up to the main 
summit).  Instead, mother nature decided to give us about 2 inches of 
fresh, Friday night snow and plenty of ice along the trail, not to mention 
that the trail was far steeper and more strenuous than my memory would have 
me believe.  Armed with a ski pole or ice axe each but no crampons, we 
inched our way up the slick, icy trail for over two hours, often 
questioning our ability to descend what we were so laboriously 
climbing.  Just after 12:00, we reached Noon Peak (there was no intention 
for this timing to happen!), decided that we all wanted to return before 
dark, and decided to halt our ascent in favor of a short lunch and an 
amazing view of the Waterville Valley area, including Mt. Tecumseh, the 
Tri-Pyramids, and Mt. Whiteface.  That short break was long enough to 
hammer home the benefits of layering gloves and how quickly the body cools 
when stopped.  After a few minutes of warming our hands, we began our slow 
descent on the steep trail, with frequent slip-and-falls, but with 
amazingly few problems on the difficult sections.  By 3:00, we were at the 
comfort of our cars, thankful for the beautiful weather and a safe return 
from the mountain, but knowing that crampons or grippers are a must in the 
mountains, even if Boston's weather indicates otherwise!

Hoping for another great weekend of winter hiking!
Pat
