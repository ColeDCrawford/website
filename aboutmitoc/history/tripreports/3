Subject: Another MITOC Trip Report

Luke and I drove up to Camelot in my trusty van Saturday night. We
were expecting the cabin to be open so Luke could sleep inside.
However because of the problems keeping the cabin ONLY 58 degrees
above the outside air temperature the night before we were left
abandoned outside. Luke managed to survive -20 degrees Fahrenheit in
his summer sleeping bag and an extra blanket. The next morning with
the sun up the temperature was back up to -16. The van would not start
so we beat a hasty retreat under the covers until it was -5. The van still
did not start so we got a jump start, but that did not work. We then
warmed up the oil pan with a Whisper Lite stove and got another jump
start. The second person had a can of ether and that worked like a
charm.

We then drove to Lincoln where we meet Rick, Benjamin Barrett and
Holly at Elvios. (Why do MITOC trips keep bumping into Rick at
Elvios?) After dinner drove 10 minutes to the Wilderness Trail parking
lot. We should have car pooled from Lincoln because there was a $7 fee
per car for parking. Last year there was no one there after dark.

We skied from 6pm to 10:45 along the Pemi. The moon was bright; the
sky was clear at the start and slightly overcast at the end. I managed to
make the whole trip without removing my headlamp from my pack.
Snow conditions were good. There was a light crust on 8 inches of
powder which was over a harder base. The coverage was excellent
considering the warm winter so far; there were less than 10 stream
crossing that we had to side step.

Even though the temperature was down to -5 degrees Fahrenheit by the
end we needed considerably warmer wax to stick because the snow was
old and crusty. The person who traded off on using the waxless skis had
a tough time making forward progress in the cold conditions.

All in all the trip was entirely enjoyable. The moonlight added a serene
atmosphere to the trip. We were able to stay warm by skiing at
consistent moderate pace and keeping breaks short.

Rick and I drove home afterwards and left Benjamin Barrett and Holly
to try to keep warm camping out at Camelot. (They have not been
heard of since.)


PS
On the way home the van's electrical system failed. With a new
battery and tightened fan belts the van now runs like a 15 year old
van again.
