	With what is becoming our typical alpine start, JD Albert '97 and I 
loaded up his trusty blue '65 Ford Falcon van and departed Cambridge at about
8 PM friday night.  Pausing briefly at REI in Reading we plowed north, 
averaging 50 mph on the flats.  We were once again waylaid in Woodstock NH by 
an officer of the peace who pulled us over and asked if we had been smoking
marijuana.  (The van is kinda suspicious looking, and the 'one love' bumper 
sticker doesn't help)  We hadn't, and we hadn't been drinking, and we hadn't 
any contraband in the car, and yes we were at least properly equipped to go 
camping, and so on and so forth.  The officer was so befuddled by the 
incongruity of our sobriety that she didn't notice the nonexistant 
inspection sticker and we went on our way.  Finally arriving at the base of 
the DOC Lodge Road in the wee hours of Saturday morning, we made a pot of 
grub and layed out our sleeping bags next to the van under the fog.  
	Awakened by the arrival Saturday morning of an AMC telemark trip, we 
saddled up and hit the trail.  Immediately beyond the lodge we found our chosen
Asquam Ridge Trail untraveled and began breaking trail in snowshoes on a foot 
of moderately crusted snow.  We found little ice damage as we climbed steadily
under quiet overcast conditions.  Gaining the Beaver Brook trail junction by 
midafternoon, we pitched camp, and took a nap.  The sun broke through just at 
sunset as we made up a pot of grub, melted the next day's water, and lit a 
small low-impact campfire (didn't burn through even a foot of the snow, 
scattered the ashes) to cheer the time till we could manage to fall asleep.
	Waking at first light to find clear skies and hardly a breath of wind, 
we broke camp and hurried the two miles to the summit to be rewarded with 
unparalleled views of the pemi and presidentials, and just about everything 
else.  Conditions still being very mild, we lingered on the summit for 
photography, mapwork, and to gnaw on frozen powerbars and chocolate.

Descending by the Carriage Trail we wished very much for sleds or skis with 
which to bomb down the wide, well-used trail.  Arriving at the roadhead by 
midaftnernoon, we re-entered the syphilized world in a clamor of exhaust 
and ground our way back to Boston in time to do the laundry.

Conclusion-  Decent snow and little ice damage in the Moosilauke region; good 
place to spend a weekend; lucky to have such a beautiful sunday.
