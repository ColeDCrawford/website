I wonder if bcox is confusing hoar frost and rime ice?
The answer to the calm nights question below I think is simply due to a
larger thermal gradient being set up right at the ground if it's calm.

Anyway, Steven Andrews (once a winter intern at Mt Washington observatory)
explains:

Hoar frost is just regular frost that happens to have extra large
crystals.  It forms on calm clear nights when the ground radiatively
cools, and water vapor from the supersaturated air then condenses out as
frost (just like dew).  So on windward vs. leeward, I'd say that it forms
primarily on calm nights (although I'm not sure why), so the wind
direction isn't really relevant.  The main factor determining its
distribution is the quality of the surface as a blackbody radiator and the
amount of clear sky visible from the location.

A sort of similar looking thing is rime ice.  Rime is caused by
supercooled fog droplets impacting onto solid things, and then instantly
freezing.  Thus, rime "feathers" always grow upwind.  With rime ice, it
grows fastest with high winds and dense fog, such as one finds on mountain
tops and on airplane wings.
