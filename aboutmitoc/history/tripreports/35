Subject: Urban Whitewater Trip Report!

It all started on Tuesday when I had a job interview in Maynard (near
Concord) and drove over a bridge in town and noticed some pretty good size
rolling waves. It looked like fun so I announced that I was interested in
paddling whatever river it was.

Much to my surprise, the river is actually written up and several people had
kayaked it before. It's called the Assabet river and there is a nice 2 mile
stretch of class I-II rapids that literally goes through town (in some
places in a concrete drainage canal!). 

As the weather called for snow only 3 hearty people decided to join in:
Chris Barett, Emilie Rinard, and Bill Finger. As Chris said in his reply for
participants: "Your idea sounds half-baked and ill-timed.  Please count me in!"

I awoke Saturday morning at 8:00 to a wonderfully sunny day. After getting
ready and heading out the door the snow started. And it was a pretty good
snow too! Having already made plans to meet Millie in Concord we were at the
very least obligated to load boats and drive out to the river.

Once we met Millie we left one car at the North Bridge parking lot in
Concord, another at the Elks club in Maynard (at the end of the class I-II
section) and proceeded with the boats up to the put in at the 117/62 bridge.
At this point we were in a complete blizzard, but the temperature was still
a relatively balmy 35-40 degrees!

After donning wetsuits / drysuits, hats, gloves, helmets, etc.... we
launched the boats. The first bridge was easy and had some fun chop in front
of it. The second bridge had a strange current going under it and because we
had to duck to avoid a low hanging pipe we all took a terrible line on the
wrong side of a rock and stuffed all the boats into a great big wave. Pretty
fun! And so it went... The first 2 miles shot by in 15 minutes. Little
rapids and pools followed by an occasional set of bigger rapids with some
nice rolling waves! The canoe proved to be difficult to get through the big
waves as it simply took on water when we stuffed the bow under and became a
pig to drive... Bill and Chris didn't have this problem in the kayaks though.

After finishing the fun upper part we decided to by-pass the first vehicle
and paddle all the way into Concord, another 6 miles. This took us another
2.5 hours and was a very enjoyable paddle. Except for one dam that needs to
be portaged and another that you can shoot through the paddling is mainly
flat and the scenery incredibly beautiful.  Bill and Christand  were going
to run the dam, except that a super low bridge foiled there plans... good
thing considering the drop was 10+ feet! The run through the second dam was
a blast as the water and a rock generated 2 or 3 really good size waves,
which despite a great roller coaster run through still managed to almost
fill up the canoe due to the volume of water. Oh well, that's why we had
wetsuits! 

The rest of the paddle was laid back as we simply enjoyed the beauty of
being on the river in a pleasant snow storm with only the water, trees and
ducks around us. After pulling out at the North Bridge in Concord, we
retrieved the vehicles, changed into warm dry clothes, and headed off to
Brighams for ice cream! (well, not really... we all just got a warm lunch).
Then we headed back to Boston a very happy bunch.

Happy ventures,

Scott
