Subject: Trip Report: Imp Trail

Bill Finger, Jen Kiest, Rick MacDonald, and Matt Sweetland gathered at 8am
Saturday morning for a pleasant hike on the Imp Trail, located off of Route
16 near the junction with route 2, in the White Mtns.  After obtaining
crampons and snowshoes, we left at 8:20 for the open road.  (Ahh, the
pleasure of small groups.)

We reached the trailhead by noon, after a short stopover at MickieD's for a
"treat."  The snow was light and powdery, but three of the four used
crampons just in case.  The trail towards the ridgeline was of gentle slope,
and passed through a lovely stand of hemlocks.  The evidence of the icestorm
was clear, as many trees were still bent under the weight of their icy
burdens, and it glittered in the afternoon sunlight.

As the trail climbed higher, we caught glimpses of the spectacular view that
the trail provides.  Although the forecast was for partly cloudy weather, we
were blessed with an azure sky and great visibility.  The higher we went,
the more trees were downed, and clambering over, under, or around them
slowed our progress.

We reached the Imp Face view at 3:00, and ate our lunch in sunshine, with
great views of Mt. Washington.  A heavy cloud bank could be seen hugging the
next ridge, but in the still air it made no progress towards us.  Rick had
very thoughtfully brought a thermos of coffee, heavily dosed with sugar and
milk, which made him very popular.

After our hunger was sated, we headed back the way we came.  After clearing
the worst of the downed trees, we donned our snowshoes, and headed downhill
posthaste.  We made it to the car in about an hour, and headed home.  We
stopped at Wendy's for a well deserved meal, and to leave Rick with a
friend, as his weekend adventures were not yet over.  The rest of us made it
back to the 'Tute at around 9pm.
