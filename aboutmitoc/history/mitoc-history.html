Ski racing was an         early focus of the club, and for the first decade of its existence, MITOC         was the MIT Ski Team. </p>      <p>The First Five Years - By the club's fifth anniversary, it had grown         to the second largest club on campus. There were near weekly trips, with         a bulletin board announcing Trips Out in Building 3. The �uniform� of         the club membership was a red flannel shirt with the triangular MITOC         patch, featuring a beaver. Most of the trips in the first few decades         of the club's existence were done in conjunction with all girl's schools,         such as Wellesley and Mt. Holyoke. MITOC becomes very active in <a href="http://www.ioca.org/">IOCA</a>,         the Intercollegiate Outing Club Association. It hosted many IOCA events,         and has faithfully attended annual trips such as Fall Lake George since         these early years.
