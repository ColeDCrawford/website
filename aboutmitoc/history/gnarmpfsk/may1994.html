      GNARMPFSK is the MIT Outing Club's periodic newsletter.  It is
      normally sent out on _paper_ to all current members up to once per
      season.  However, in order to expedite and simplify the publication
      process for this issue, it is being distributed in electronic form
      (hence the "e").  Please send all submissions for future issues, as
      well as any questions or comments, to mitoc-owner@mit.edu. Have a
      great summer!

MITOC Spring Circus 1994 took place at Camelot Cabin over the weekend
of April 15th - 18th and prompted responses such as these:


     "The sun was good.  The rain was bad.  Being on the water was cool.
      Being in the water was cold.  Staying at the cabin was fun.  Getting
      to the cabin was weird.  I'll be back next year."


     "My memories of Circus include slogging through thigh deep snow,
      clinging precariously to a tall boulderface while scrabbling for the
      next foothold, waking up to find warm oatmeal and delicious pancakes
      waiting downstairs, cramming into a small car for a several hour
      drive, walking under the stars at midnight, breathing deeply of the
      cold, fresh air, and just generally revelling in the opportunity to
      get away from the city and be Outside again."


The other 40 - or so people who attended were reportedly too busy with
schoolwork to comment.  Sorry if you missed it, cause you missed a lot
of fun.  Watch out for Fall Circus, coming up in October!

MITOC annual elections take place in March.  This year we had a
roaring success, filling all our positions and holding the first
competitive elections in years!  Welcome to all our new officers!
(For a listing of results, you can see the file
/mit/mitoc/admin/minutes/officers as detailed in section iii.)

The MITOC office, W20-461, will soon make room for more people and
equipment!  MITOC has been promised W20-461 for another five years
before the next ASA assessment of student group office space.  In
exchange, we are happy to welcome the MIT Cycling Club and the MIT
Caving Club to our home.  If you are interested in these groups, you
can contact Yehoram "yhofman@mit.edu" Hofman and Seth "swebster@mit.edu"
Webster, respectively.  We look forward to the prospect of rich
cultural exchange!  (It's not too much of a stretch.)

We have recently acquired a bunch of brand new NNN skiis and boots, in
hope of more wonderful winters.  Our current fleet of cross-country
and back-country skis all relies on old, three-pin technology.  Matt
Knapp's father has bargained on our behalf to get us 8 pairs of
cross-country skiis with NNN bindings, and 15 pairs of NNN boots.
"New Nordic Norm" bindings work by clipping a metal axle on the boot
into a receptor on the binding.  In addition, they have grooves on
boot and ski which make for much better stability and durability.
Many thanks to Mr. Knapp! MITOC still does not rent back-country
boots.  (Also motivated by wonderous amounts of snow and a
correspondingly heavy use this past winter, MITOC is investing in more
Sherpa snowshoes!  These will arrive later.)

We have also recently bought new Scarpa rock-climbing shoes.  MITOC
policy allows members to rent rock-climbing shoes, harnesses, and
helmets -- no rope & no rack!  Want to test out our fancy new shoes?
Look for summer climbing classes in the summer schedule, below.

The vast majority of MITOC organization and planning is done over the
Internet, in particular over email, as most of you receiving this are
well aware.  As we build new cabins and buy new equipment, we just
can't seem to help spending some of our time also creating more online
documentation, graphics, and software.  Here are some ways you can
reach MITOC's wealth of data:

o  If you have access to Athena, you can reach the source of most of
     MITOC's files.  To reach our directory, use the following commands at
     an Athena prompt:
            attach mitoc
            cd /mit/mitoc
            ls
     You will find a variety of directories with everything from trip
     schedules to shopping places to a list of Inuit words describing
     different types of snow.  In addition, all subscribers to mitoc have
     writing privileges on these files .. if you want to add something to
     them, go ahead! Please use the format of notating your changes
     outlined in /mit/mitoc/README .

o  Whether of not you have access to Athena, if you have an account
     "on" the Internet, you can use Techinfo and thus reach much of the
     MITOC files with a nicer interface.  Simply telnet to techinfo.mit.edu
     and make the selections  "Ongoing Activities"  "Clubs"
     "Clubs N-Z"  "Outing Club".  MITOC has one of the more extensive
     club directories on Techinfo; please explore and make use of it so
     that it is worthwhile to upkeep!

o (BRAND NEW) Best of all, if you have access to MOSAIC (or another
     interface to the World Wide Web), you can try out our brand new World
     Wide Web Home Page.  In this case you can use hypertext to find the
     info' you want, and along the way find photos and sounds relevant to
     MITOC activities! Wheeee!  Many thanks go to Jim Reardon for
     administrating the Page, and to Sheung Li for digitizing photos.

URL for Home Page: http://afs/athena/activity/m/home.html


There is also a rumour that MITOC will be computerizing its inventory,
membership, and rental databases over the summer.  Look out for
upcoming bugs! -- er, I mean efficiency!

If you have anything (like ideas) you would like to submit to one of these
sources, you can send mail to mitoc-owner@mit.edu ...

Yes, MITOC still has two properties, more or less on the east and west
sides of the White Mountain National Forest in NH.  More precisely,
MITOC owns a significant property and a 15-year old MITOC-built cabin
"Camelot" near Rumney (near Plymouth), NH, and another smaller
property, Intervale, near North-Conway, NH.

The latter currently boasts the following: ample tenting space; ashes
and a foundation from Intervale II; soil from the decomposed ashes of
Intervale I; a brand-new (one-year old) black Yurt (which badly needs
murals painted on its outside); and a brand-new (not-yet-finished!)
cabin, "Intervale III."  The Yurt can sleep at least 6 people; if you
want to use it, pay the club $3 per person per night.  If you want to
use the new cabin Intervale III, go instead on the work trip detailed
below in the summer schedule!  There is only a weekend's or so of work
to do, and it has proven so far to be lots of fun! Contact Pearl
"tsai@theory.lcs.mit.edu" Tsai for information.

Camelot cabin has a keyholder policy whereby groups and individuals
using it must include or be accompanied by a MITOC-approved keyholder.
If you would like to become such an entity, come on the Keyholder
Checkout And Worktrip Weekend, May 20th - 22nd, 1994.  Contact Scott
"stuart@ll.mit.edu" Stuart for details.  There are lots of wonderful
things that could be done to Camelot; we will be doing some of these
that weekend.  Also, there may well be work going on almost
continuously over the summer beautifying Camelot, so look out for trip
announcements, and plan your stay there!

Unscheduled Stuff:
-----------------

Rental hours during the summer should continue as normal: Monday and
Thursdays from 5:30 - 6:30 p.m.

Scott "stuart@ll.mit.edu" Stuart will be holding various work trips /
keyholder trips to Camelot.  If you would be interested, tell him when
you want them to be!

Scott "stuart@ll.mit.edu" Stuart will also be leading a weekend / 3-4
day trip to the Adirondacks.  Will it be in late July, or over
Memorial Day in May? Contact him to help decide and work out the
details if you're interested.  The trip could work either by settting
up a base camp near the cars and doing day hikes, or backpacking it.

Remember, if you want to do something, just post to mitoc and organize it!
You'll find leaders and vehicles, even if you aren't supplying either.

        Aren't we nice?


Saturday, June 11, 1994:    Introduction to Climbing

        Come see if you like the idea of scaling small cliffs with your bare
        hands.  And if you still like the idea of climbing come next weekend
        for an extensive climbing class that will help prevent you from
        killling yourself and others while climbing,

        Climbing will take place at Hammond Pond in Newton. All gear will be
        provided by MITOC. Meet at MITOC offices at 12 noon Saturday. Expect
        to be back around dusk. Rain cancels (i.e. if the street is wet.) The
        rain date is Sunday. This trip will cost $6.00 for members.


Saturday - Sunday, June 11 - 12: Intervale III Work Trip!!

        Help finish MITOC's beautiful new cabin in Intervale, NH.
        No special skills needed (maybe even learn a few!).
        Meet other fun MITOC people!  If time permits,
        maybe we'll even go hiking nearby.
        For more information, email Pearl at tsai@sonata.lcs.mit.edu
        or call 253-6035.


Thursday, June 16.  18:30 p.m. W20-461   MEETING!

        June BOD meeting. Everyone welcome.


Saturday - Sunday,  June 18 to June 19:    Beginning Climbing Class

        This is an extensive beginning climbing class teaching the
        fundamentals of safe roped climbing. This includes learning the body
        belay, belaying with a device, tieing in to a bowline-on-a-coil and
        harnesses, prusicking, rapelling, and oh yes climbing up rock.

        You must pre-register for this class by June 13. You will be expected
        to prepare for the class by reading some material on climbing and
        learning how to tie a knots.

        Class will take place at Rumney, NH. We will be leaving from MITOC on
        Friday at 7PM and returning on Sunday by 9pm. We will be staying at
        Camelot. A real bad weather forecast cancels the class.

        The trip will cost $40. This includes two nights at Camelot and free
        rentals of climbing gear for the rest of the summer. Class size limited
        to 8.

MITOC has lots of old STUFF, otherwise known as outdoor equipment.
Beautiful though its history of service may be, we want to get rid of
a lot of it.  Up for grabs are:

     o  ancient downhill ski boots.  (many, free)

     o  fibreglass kayaks and C2's, in poor condition. (10$ each)  For
           information, contact gideon@ai.mit.edu before they're all gone.

     o  really old rock shoes (cheap; make us an offer)

At the same time, we like free stuff!  Before you throw out anything
that might help to furnish Intervale III, or our office on campus,
offer it to us!  Does anyone want to donate a '286+ DOS PC? Some huge
cabinets?  A van?

MITOC carries a number of periodicals.  Please be aware of them so
they don't go unused.  Just like all our books and videos, you can
sign them out for free with a deposit cheque.  We carry:

     Outside
     Climbing
     Rock and Ice
     Backpacker
     FOOTNOTES
     Wilderness Medicine

and a variety of other newsletters & magazines, as well as backissues
for years and years.  We also have CATALOGS from most of the retailers
and manufacturers of outdoor fabrics, clothing, equipment, books, and

The head of MITOC's "British Imperial Ramblers Association," with
which some of you may be familiar, has moved to UCLA and will soon be
moving more permanently to Israel.  He sends us this from the east
coast:

     If MITOC has made me even mildly less lazy, I applied my newfound
     enthusiasm for climbing things to knocking my UCLA class quickly into
     shape. I made the first assignment for my undergraduate class on
     Transportation Geography due at the top of Mount Lowe. The students
     were doing an analysis of why the Los Angeles streetcar system went
     out of business, and it seemed appropriate for them to travel to the
     terminus of what had been the most famous rail line of all.

     Not many people know that there are some extraordinary mountains just
     behind Los Angeles, and that within minutes you can leave freeways and
     smog behind and be in the middle of nowhere. My students were pretty
     surprised to be going up a mountain as part of a class, and were
     equally surprised by the steepness of the trail, more than two hours
     of huffing and puffing in conquest. At the top, I took their
     assignments and had them do oral presentations. Luckily UCLA does not
     have an Institute Screw with which to present me!
