an overnight up in the high peaks area.  A friend of Stu's wants to hold a
forum on outdoor skills on Friday and may plan to build a shelter to
overnight in.  This trip was a lot of fun last year and Stu expects to have

Fri-Sat-Sun, Feb 5-7th<br>
<i>Tarjei Mikkelsen, <a href="mailto:tarjei@mit.edu">tarjei@mit.edu</a></i><br>
Mount Washington, 6288 ft., is the highest peak in the northeast.
The frequent combination of cold temperature and high wind prevalent 
on the summit, especially in winter, has earned for Mount Washington 
the title, "home of the world's worst weather". Though, on a good day,
the summit offers amazing views of the White Mountains region.
We will ascend the mountain via the Lion's Head winter trail which is
non-technical, but still very steep and possibly icy, hence good 
mountaineering skills, including proficiency with ice axe and crampos 
will be neccessary.<br>
We will leave for New Hampshire on the night of Friday 2/5, stay over
at the Intervale cabin, and climb Mt. Washington the next day. After 
spending a second night at the cabin, we will return to Boston on Sunday
morning.
