Last updated October 2017

The below contains information which you must read and follow. This is not an online license agreement.

All official events at the cabin must follow all MIT rules including the [Alcohol Policy](https://handbook.mit.edu/alcohol) and the [Nondiscrimination Policy.](https://handbook.mit.edu/nondiscrimination)

In summary the alcohol policy reads as below. For any updates refer to the link above.

MIT prohibits any persons under the age of 21 from possessing or consuming alcohol. Additionally, MIT prohibits persons from providing, serving, or selling alcohol to any person, except as expressly allowed in Institute policy 9.11.2. Small social gatherings (usually considered to be 25 guests or fewer) at which alcohol is served to individuals over the age of 21 is not considered a violation of this policy.

MIT also prohibits inappropriate behaviors that result from the use of alcohol by persons of any age, including but not limited to public intoxication, driving while under the influence of alcohol, vandalism, and behaviors that require an intervention by Institute sta , cause a disturbance, or are a danger to persons (self or others) or property.

Other alcohol-related behaviors prohibited by MIT include but are not limited to: the possession or use of false identification to purchase alcohol, possession of open containers of alcohol in public spaces, consumption from quantity dispensing sources (e.g. kegs, punch bowls, water coolers, beer balls or garbage cans) on campus (except for events receiving the approval specified in the Event Planning Guide) or in Institute-approved housing, engaging in drinking games or other activities involving rapid and/or excessive consumption of alcohol on campus or in Institute-approved housing, and hosting events where alcohol is present or consumed without prior approval, as required by the Event Planning Guide.

MIT also adheres to the provisions concerning alcohol under the federal Drug-Free Workplace and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Acts (DFSCA).

The Institute does not intend through its guidelines or policies to restrict the responsible use of alcohol by members of the MIT community who are at or above the legal drinking age of 21. However, efforts to observe existing laws and regulations in an environment where the majority of the undergraduate student body is not of legal drinking age will impose some constraints on those who are of legal drinking age.

## Purpose


This document is intended as an instruction set for Intervale Property Users and Keyholders. It is similar to the instructions told to new Keyholders and Property Users during training trips. However, this document is not a substitute for a training trip. If you want to become a Keyholder or Property User for Intervale, you must attend one of these trips. Normally, there are two Keyholder trips per year, once in late spring and once in early fall and four Property User trips per year. The trips are announced on the following mailing lists: mitoc, mitoc-announce, and intervale-keyholders. Join our [Mailing Lists](/mailing-lists) to stay up to date. If you have any questions about Intervale, or about these instructions, please contact the current Intervale Manager for more info.

### Property User

A Property User is a person who has attended a half-day training trip at Intervale. These sessions are the Cabin Manager's opportunity to discuss rules, show folks the RoW and answer any questions. Property Users are allowed to camp and use the yurt at Intervale.

### Keyholder

A Keyholder is a person who has attend a full-day training trip at Intervale. These trainings teach members how to properly access and close the cabin.

* * *

## Why Trainings?


Every group that uses Intervale, no matter how small or large, must be accompanied by a Keyholder or Property User. Every group simply using the grounds must have a Property User present. In additionally, any reservation must be prior approved by a Cabin Manager. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that there is always at least one person at the property who is familiar with its quirks and who will be explicitly responsible for the duration of the stay.

## Types of Use


The cabin tends to get used in three different scenarios that determine who has responsibility for ensuring the safety of the cabin and its occupants.

The first scenario occurs when a large trip (such as Circus) uses the property for an exclusive event. This group must be attended by a Keyholder and the Keyholder is responsible for the reservation, deposit, and any issues that arise from use of the property.

The second scenario is when a Keyholder takes a small group of her friends to the cabin. Then, the Keyholder generally writes the deposit check for the cabin, and is ultimately responsible for payment and conduct while at the cabin. Other groups may be at the property with this group.

The third scenario is when a group of MITOC members wishes to camp or use the yurt. Then, a Property User makes the reservation and is ultimately responsible for the group.

Any use of the property must be explicitly approved by a Cabin Manager.

## Reserving the Property


Anyone interested in renting Intervale should visit the [Intervale Page](/rentals/intervale) on the MITOC Website for information about how to reserve Intervale as well as madatory rules for every reservation.

### Deposit Checks

Before you can use the cabin itself, someone must leave a $1000 deposit check with the MITOC desk. The deposit check will be destroyed after you return at your request, else MITOC can keep the check for up to a year as a valid deposit for a future cabin reservation.

### Before You Go

Before you set out for the cabin, make sure that you know who the group leader is, and that she has received a copy of these instructions. Also, make sure that you and the group leader know how to get to the cabin.

## Property User And Keyholder Responsibilities


The Property User/Keyholder is responsible for escorting any person crossing the RoW at any time for any reason. No guest should cross the RoW without a Property User or Keyholder present.

The Property User/Keyholder is responsible for the actions of the group and is the organizer for the stay. It is assumed that she will make a good faith effort to instruct the group on safe usage of the cabin, and to warn them of any dangerous or stupid activities.

If there are any problems with members of the group it is then up to the Property User/Keyholder to enforce proper behavior.

When the Property User/Keyholder first determines that a problem is occurring, she should first inform the group members as to how to correct the situation. If that does not resolve the problem, the Property User/Keyholder should contact the Cabin Managers upon return to Boston who will then follow up with the situation.

The reserving party MUST be present at the property for the duration of the reservation with their group. Reservations cannot be transferred to other individuals; a separate reservation request must be submitted.

### Fires

There is a fire ring near the cabin. This is the only place on the grounds where a fire is permissible. What is the difference between a cooking fire and a bonfire? The line is a fuzzy one, but a cooking fire is small. Thus the fires in the fire ring should be kept to a reasonably small size.

Whenever there is a fire or smoldering coals in the fire ring, someone should be supervising it. There is a tendency for a group of people to assume that someone else is managing the fire, so make sure that one person knows that he or she is responsible for the fire and will stay with the fire until it is out.

No open flames are permitted in the yurt, cabin, or any other part of the property except in the fire ring or as part of normal operation of the stove.

### Outhouse

Restroom facilities at Intervale consist of two-stall outhouse a short distance from the cabin. The trail to the cabin is marked with reflectors such that you can find it in the dark. There should be toilet paper at the outhouse, and there is more in the cabin. Please insure that it is protected from the animals which will quickly shred it. If the toilet paper supply is low, please tell the cabin manager .

### Cleaning Up

Please leave the property at least as clean as you found it. Check the fire pit and area around the cabin for trash. If people from your group are leaving early, have them take some garbage with them in case it won't all fit in the remaining cars.

### After Returning to Cambridge

If you experienced any problems, or you have any concerns about the cabin, please contact the cabin manager as soon as you can. Be sure to send the completed checklist to the Cabin Manager.

## Additional Keyholder Responsibilities


Keyholders share all of the responsibilities described above as well as the additional ones below.

### Arriving At The Cabin

Fill out the first part of the cabin checklist. Have people take their personal gear to the loft or the hooks at the far corners of the den. People have a tendency to dump their stuff in the middle of the floor, where it gets in everyone's way and is probably even a fire hazard. Please instruct everyone to leave their shoes/boots on the tiled floor at the door. The hardwood floors are in beautiful condition and snow, dirt, etc, from outside will quickly scratch them.

### Turning on the Gas

1.  Identify the tank marked as "IN USE", make sure all tanks other tanks are off by checking the valve on the top of the tanks and open the tank you wish to use.
2.  Below the regulator is the master shut-off. If the red lever is perpendicular to the gas line it is OFF, turn it parallel to the gas line for ON.
3.  Above the regulator between the second and third tank is the bank selector. Turn it to face the direction (left or right) the tank which you wish to use.

### Lighting the Lamps

After turning on the gas, check to see if it is working by lighting one of the lamps in the cabin. Each lamp has a switch on the side of it which is raised to turn the gas on. First, light a match (or use the lighter if there is on) and then turn on the gas. Now hold the flame BELOW the mantle without actually touching the match, lighter, or anything else, to the mantle. The lamp should light quickly. The mantles are extremely fragile (and expensive) so please do not tough them either with your hands, the match, the lighter, or anything else. In cold weather, it may take a few moments for the gas to flow through the line.

### Changing the Bottle

If after several tries, the lamp does not light, it is possible that the current gas bottle is empty and you will need to switch the regulator to a different bottle, which is quite easy. Return to the bottles behind the cabin.

1.  Turn off the main shut-off by returning the red-lever to be perpendicular to the gas line.
2.  Close **all** tanks by close the valves on the top of all tanks.
3.  Replace the now old "IN USE" tag with an "EMPTY"
4.  Find a bottle with a "FULL" tag on it. Open this bottle up using the valve on top of it.
5.  Replace the "FULL" tag with an "IN USE" tag.
6.  Turn the bank selector to face the bottle you wish to use.
7.  Now re-open the main shutoff by turning the red lever to the parallel position. 8. Please tell the cabin manager that one of the bottles is now empty, along with how many full bottles are remaining on the regulator.

### Turning Off the Gas

1.  Make sure ALL gas appliances inside are turned off.
2.  Go behind the cabin and close ALL bottles, including the one marked as "IN USE"
3.  Turn the selector knob to face directly up.
4.  Turn off the master lever by turning the red lever below the regulator to be perpendicular to the gas line.

**NOTE:** There are several other levers on various gas lines under the cabin and going into the cabin. Don't turn those levers off. Only manipulate the levers behind the cabin as described above.

### Propane Heater

Intervale is heated by a propane heater. Directions for lighting the furnace are found on the panel on the bottom of the heater after removing the cover. Note that it may take a full minute or two of holding the black knob down in the "PILOT" position before the spark will ignite the pilot light.

### The Kitchen and Stove

Feel free to leave behind **non-perishable unopened** in the appropriate cabinets, and feel free to take some food from the cabinets in return.

Intervale is equipped with a propane stove for cooking. Once the gas is turned on, lighting the burners is rather straigtforward. Turn the knob of the appropriate burned to the setting marked "light". The stove is equiped with a battery for the lighter. If the lighter isn't working due to a dead batter touch a match to the burner. The oven is also gas, and is lit using the same battery lighter. If the battery is dead you can light the oven with a match by carefully lighting the oven pilot under the stove toward the back. Don't try this if you haven't been shown how. Please make sure that the stove top is clean and sparkly white before you leave.

Glasses, plates, bowls, and utensils all have storage cabinets. Make sure that they are all properly put away and that the cabinets are properly closed.

Water at Intervale is drawn from a spring located over the hill by the large wooden platform. There are containers for carrying water to the cabin. The water from this spring has been tested, and is believed to be safe for drinking but you may want to boil it just to be sure. Please be careful around the spring such that it does not become contaminated.

Waste water should be deposited in the sump which is near the cabin. When you leave the cabin, make sure that all water is poured out. Do not leave empty plastic water containers in the kitchen. Take them back to Cambridge with you and recycle them.

The most efficient way to wash dishes at Intervale is to use the tubs on the counter in the back. Heat some water on the stove. If you are with a large group, you will need lots of water, and it will take a long time to heat. You should make every effort to start heating the water immediately as soon as dinner has been cooked, and before everyone eats (or even before dinner is cooked if there is room on the stove.) You can use water that was used to boil pasta or vegetables as the first round of cleaning water. Fill one tub full of hot soapy water, and the other full of hot rinse water. Wash, rinse, and place the drippy dishes in the dish rack on the counter. Be sure to clean the counters, and the stove, with hot water.

### Cleaning

Additionally, leave the cabin at least as clean as you found it. Clean all of the counters and tables. Sweep out the loft and living area. Take all of your garbage with you. Organize the chairs and kitchen items.

There is no garbage service at Intervale. You must take all garbage with you. Please survey the cabin and grounds before leaving to make sure that you have cleaned up all of your trash.

## Intervale's Neighbors


Contrary to popular belief, Intervale is not in an isolated wilderness. There are indeed neighbors, and they can be disturbed by the actions of Intervale's users. In particular, please respect the privacy of the neighbors who live in the houses along the path up to the cabin. Do not shine headlamps toward those buildings and try to avoid arriving/leaving between the hours of 12A-6A. Please respect all of our neighbors' privacy, and do not do anything to worsen the situation. Be quiet at all times while passing their property and do not shine your lamps on their property. Additionally, only use their property to access our property; do not stop or loiter at any time on any property not maintained by MITOC. Nor should you leave any trash on their property.

It is the responsibility of the Keyholder or Property User to be present during all RoW crossing by their group and ensure that everyone in their group adheres to the regulations described here.

* * *

## Parking


Parking for the cabin is in a small lot about 100 yards after you turn off 16A. There is also a small Ski Club lodge just off this parking lot. Do not park anywhere else but here, not even to unload gear. If you attempt to drive the rest of the way, you may disturb our neighbors. Please keep in mind that this parking lot is owned by the Ski Club. MITOC has been granted permission to park here under two conditions.

*   That MITOC leave enough space such that the Ski Club can park two cars side-byside in the lot on the right without blocking the drive way.
*   That MITOC not block the driveway of the Ski Club.

The nearest house to Intervale is generally not visible through the trees, but it is not all that far away. Sounds carry surprisingly well. So, make sure that group remains reasonably quiet, especially at night. People from the cabin should not go wandering around on other people's property.
