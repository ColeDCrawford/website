  ### Trail conditions

  *   [Views from the Top](http://www.viewsfromthetop.com/forums/) is a great place to find trail conditions. It is also a great place and the most active place where people talk about different hiking trails in NH.
  *   [Mt. Washington Avalanche Center](http://www.tuckerman.org/) gives detailed avalanche advisories in and around Mt. Washington.
  *   [Mohamed Ellozy's great NH mountains website](http://home.earthlink.net/~ellozy/) Has book times online and trail descriptions.

  ### Weather

  *   [Snow Depth](http://www.erh.noaa.gov/nerfc/graphics/snowmaps/html/snow_depth.html) Info on the latest snowfall amounts
  *   [Mt Washington Observatory](http://www.mountwashington.org/) has the best weather forecasts for the White Mountains. The high summits forecast is particularly useful, particularly for forecasting wind speeds up to a day in advance. Also available via a voice recording: (603) 356-2137, Press 1.
  *   [Aviation Forecast](http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/launch/code.cgi?Submit=Go&sta=KMWN&state=NH) Useful for wind estimates, though be sure to check the observatory forecast the day of from the link on the previous bullet.
  *   [The Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com) has detailed forecasts and will show history for any range of days up to a full year. On the main page after looking up your location, go to History & Almanac on the lower left hand side. You can view it as a calendar or a graph. This could be useful in seeing if there has been a freeze/thaw cycle.

  ### Trail Maps

  *   [Hill Map](http://www.hillmap.com/) Trails overlaid onto google maps. Distances not always accurate.
  *   [Terraserver](http://www.terraserver-usa.com/) USGS topo maps for the entire US. There is a "download" link which allows you to save an image of the map you are viewing. Keep in mind that many of the trails marked on the USGS topos may have moved since the last update (often 20-30 years ago).
  *   [ACME Mapper](http://mapper.acme.com/) A very fun and useful webpage.

  Dear Mt. Monroe Trip Participants

  Please READ the following advice on your trip. ALL of you should read the following in its entirety.

  The following is instructions and advice on your Winter School trip. Please read it IN ITS ENTIRETY. Please complete the section at the bottom and return the information to me and Bob Beaver ASAP, along with any questions.

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  LEADERS:

  Bob Beaver (617.461.0987) & Fruity Loopy (617.461.1234)

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  THE ROUTE:

  We'll hike Mt. Monroe from Marshfield Station at the base of the Cog Railway in Bretton Woods, NH. From the station, we'll take the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail up past the AMC Lakes of the Clouds Hut and on to the summit of Mt. Monroe. This hike will be 7.2 miles round-trip and will involve about 3000' of elevation gain.

  FULL ABOVE-TREELINE GEAR INCLUDING BODY COVER, CRAMPONS, AND AN ICE AXE IS REQUIRED.

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  CONTINGENCY PLANS:

  As always, a winter ascent in the White Mountains is a gamble. Trips frequently get to treeline and have to turn around due to high winds. Make sure that you are comfortable using an Ice-axe and crampons. Also, make sure that you have tested out the gear well in advance of the actual trip. A proper fit on crampons & snowshoes is absolutely vital for your safety and the safety of others. If in doubt, consult your trip leader well in advance of the trip, or as a last resort, at the trail-head BEFORE starting the hike.

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

  This trip will offer an opportunity for participants to test their winter hiking, navigation, crampon/snowshoe, and above-treeline skills.

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  TENTATIVE SCHEDULE:

  Saturday, 8:15am: Meet at the Cog Railway base station (It is most efficient to come up I-93 and then head toward Crawford Notch, look for Cog Railway signs)  
  Saturday, 8:30am: Start up th Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail  
  Saturday, 4:30pm: Return to cars via Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail  

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  GEAR:

  By now, you should have a pretty good feel for what gear is expected of you on a trip like this, but here's a checklist for your convenience. Not all of this gear is explicitly required, but check with me if you're afraid you might be lacking in a particular area.

  Rental:

  \* Boot/crampon system that you have used previously with success. CRAMPONS REQUIRED. \* Snowshoes \* Back-Pack (should be big enough to carry all your things. Try not to stuff everything into a smaller bag!) \* Sleeping Pad

  Clothing:

  \* Legs: non-cotton long underwear (wicking), fleece pants/shell (warm, wind/water-resistant top layer) \* Body: non-cotton undershirt (wicking), fleece/wool warming layer (warming), water/wind-resistant shell (water/windproofing) \* Gloves: non-cotton glove liners (wicking), warm gloves or mittens (warming, two pair recommended), wind/water-resistant overmitts (water/windproofing) \* Face/Head: warm hat, face mask or balaclava, ski goggles

  FULL BODY COVER IS REQUIRED - NO EXCEPTIONS!

  When it's all on, is there any exposed skin? If there is, you need more clothes or a better balaclava/face mask.

  Feet: non-cotton liner socks (wicking), warm wool socks (warming), warm boots (waterproofing), crampons that fit your boots (Make sure they fit before you leave Boston!), gaiters (duct tape can be a great substitute)

  Other personal gear:

  \* At least 2-3 quarts of water, preferably in wide-mouth bottles \* Ice axe and/or hiking poles ICE AXE REQUIRED. \* headlamp (Required!) \* compass (Required!) \* whistle (Required!) \* trail food \* space blanket (a good idea) \* your leaders will provide you with a copy of the map \* Bring your cell phone or two-way radio if you have one.

  Your leaders will also carry (and may ask you to assist in carrying):

  \* sleeping bag (at least one -15 and one 0-degree bag per team) \* Pads (preferably one for every two participants) \* stove and fuel (at least one per team) \* emergency shelter (tent)

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  WEATHER:

  The ground forecast for Bretton Woods, NH is cold with highs in the low 20's (F) and light winds. Conditions on the mountain will be significantly colder, especially above treeline. Remember that the weather can change quickly and being prepared is key.

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  EXPENSES:

  Winter School Trip fee is $5 per day, to cover White Mountain Guide Permits and safety gear. Please pay this at office hours before the trip, or afterwards if you are renting gear. Plan to pay about $20 to your driver to help cover gas and maintenance costs. The Cabin fee is $5 for MITOC members, $10 for others. Bring some extra cash for breakfast, snacks, and other incidentals.

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
