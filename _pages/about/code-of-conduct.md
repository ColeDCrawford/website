### Code of Conduct

All members of the club are expected to follow the policies and ideals detailed in the [MITOC Code of Conduct](/docs/advisoryboard/MITOC-CoC-2019.pdf).

### MITOC Conduct Management Protocol

No MITOC member should feel uncomfortable or unsafe while participating in a MITOC event. If you do, contact the Conduct Review Committee via email by directly contacting one of the two members.

Find the current mediation chairs on the [club officers page](/about/officers).

The Committee Members are trained on the past practices within the Club for handling issues and on the MIT and local resources available to MITOC members for various situations. The conduct review committee aims to resolve any issue brought to them as quickly as possible and at most within 2-4 weeks.

A more detailed description of the Committee's charter can be found here: [Conduct Management Plan](/docs/advisoryboard/MITOC-CMP-2019.pdf).
