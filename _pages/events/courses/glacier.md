The club typically organizes a Crevasse Rescue and Glacier Travel course in the spring in prepration for member's summer expeditions. This is a two-day course held in the Whites focusing mostly on field work (see topics below).

### Topics Include

*   Crevasse and Snow Bridge terrain assessment
*   Planning / Team Management
*   Roped travel
*   Ascending a rope
*   Z-pulley for hauling a victim

### When

1 Weekend in the spring.

### Where

White Mountains (likely Pinkham Notch or Crawford Notch) evenings at the Intervale cabin. The course is likely to run on a small incline next to a ski resort for the first day. On the second day we will head up one of the ravines on Mt. Washington to try out our systems in a more live setting.
