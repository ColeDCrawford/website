### When

1 whole weekend. Trip will be annonced on the climbers@mit.edu mailing. Interested trip leaders may take the course elsewhere and receive the same reimbursment. As there is quite a bit of interested in this course we will try to run one each spring and fall. If curious about the trip then please contact the climbing chair: [climbing-chair@mit.edu](mailto:climbing-chair@mit.edu).

### Where

Class will be held at Cathedral or White Horse Ledge in North Conway, NH. We will stay at the Intervale cabin at night.

### Who

Self rescue is strongly recommended for climbing leaders. Priority is given to prospective climbing leaders, remaining spots are open to other MITOC members first come first serve. This course is especially beneficial for those into or getting into multi-pitch climbing.

### Costs

If you become a MITOC Climbing Leader, MITOC will subsidize your self rescue course. In order to obtain the subsidy, you MUST lead at least TWO trips. Last year, the costs were $100 (Subsidized $50). Expect that this year's costs will be similar.

### What

Techniques:*   Friction hitches / load releasable knots

*   Rescuing a fallen leader
*   Escaping belay
*   Load Transfers
*   Rope Ascension
*   Hauling systems (3-to-1 and 5-to-1)

#### Supplies

**Note:** Not much previous experience is required, however learning to tie a munter mule is definitely beneficial ahead of time. This course is _highly_ recommended for anyone looking to join our climbing leaders program ( [Become a Climbing Leader](/get-involved/become-climbing-leader) ). For participants in the course I will provide some materials to review before the course so we can focus on the higher level skills.
