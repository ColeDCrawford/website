Avalanches range in size and magnitude but can happen in many backcountry mountain situations. Whether skiing, hiking or climbing you should be aware of potential avalanche risks and how to identify potential avalanche situations. In the event that an avalanche does occur, proper training is the best hope for a rescue.
