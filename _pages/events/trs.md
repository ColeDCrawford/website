Technical Review Sessions (TRS) are mini-lectures in the MITOC office to review and practice wilderness first aid, self rescue, mountaineering, and climbing skills. We recommend joining the MITOC [mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc) or checking the [calendar](/calendar) to stay informed. These sessions are a great way to refresh and practice skills which are easily forgotten after taking the [respective courses](/events/courses). We aim to cover a scenario/skill at each session such as rescuing a follower with a ledge or without a ledge or for first aid run a few scenarios plus discussion. Sessions are run by people who have taken a course or would like to share their experiences. If you're interested in running a session, please let us know at [mitoc-bod@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-bod@mit.edu).

### Disclaimer

Most organizers and session leaders running Technical Review Sessions are not climbing guides, mountain guides, certified first-aid instructors, or medical practitioners. There will be no formal "teaching" or certification. These sessions are for practice and review. If you are interested in taking a formal course on self-rescue, general rope techniques, first aid, climbing, or mountaineering from a certified guide, we suggest you take an official course taught by certified professionals. Climbing, mountaineering, and general outdoor activities are inherently dangerous. In the event of a medical emergency, please recognize the limitations of your training and/or certifications, if any, when rendering assistance as a volunteer rescuer or race volunteer.
