### What's a Trip Report?

MITOC members embark on all kinds of awesome trips around New England and the world. When they're back at MIT, they're encouraged to present photos and stories of their adventures to inspire others to pursue cool trips.

### Present Your Trip!

Have you been on a cool adventure you'd like to share with the MITOC community? Email [mitoc-owner@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-owner@mit.edu) to set up your very own trip report social.

### Format

Typically trip report socials are about an hour long and are held in the MITOC office with food provided by MITOC. They're generally presented in the form of a photo-rich PowerPoint slideshow supplemented with stories and commentary. Trip report socials are a great way to meet people, get inspired, and inspire others to plan their own epic trips.
