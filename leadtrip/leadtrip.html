<h2>How to become a leader?</h2>
Simply fill out the form found at the specific (WS/climbing/3S hiking) leader pages. This is an informal "outdoor resume" summarzing both outdoor leadership and experience in the activity. This will be reviewed by the respective committee or chair and you will be assigned a full leader or co-leader rating.

<h2>I want to be a leader but I don't think I'm ready/qualified</h2>

Fear not! The best way to become a leader is to co-lead trips with current leaders. This gives you priority on for MITOC trips (with limited spots) and you learn all the skills and experience you need along the way. Many of our leaders started out as enthusiastic participants on our trips who became co-leaders and then leaders. 

<h2>What's the difference between leader and co-leader?</h2>
For 3 season hiking and climbing, leaders can lead trips on their own and may bring as many co-leader with them for the trip. For winter school, each trip must have either: 1 leader and 1 co-leader OR 2 leaders. 

<h2>Benefits?</h2>
This varies by type of leader but generally free gear rentals, subsidized gas, and subsidized first aid and rescue courses are involved.
