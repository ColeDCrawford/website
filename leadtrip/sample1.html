Dear Mt. Monroe Trip Participants
<p>
Please READ the following advice on your trip. ALL of you should read
the following in its entirety.
<p>
The following is instructions and advice on your Winter School trip.
Please read it IN ITS ENTIRETY.  Please complete the section at the bottom
and return the information to me and Bob Beaver ASAP, along with any
questions.
<p>
____________
<p>
LEADERS:
<p>
Bob Beaver (617.461.0987) & Fruity Loopy (617.461.1234)
<p>
____________
<p>
THE ROUTE:
<p>
We'll hike Mt. Monroe from Marshfield Station at the base of the Cog
Railway in Bretton Woods, NH.  From the station, we'll take the
Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail up past the AMC Lakes of the Clouds Hut and on
to the summit of Mt. Monroe.  This hike will be 7.2 miles round-trip
and will involve about 3000' of elevation gain.
<p>
FULL ABOVE-TREELINE GEAR INCLUDING BODY COVER, CRAMPONS, AND AN ICE AXE IS REQUIRED.
<p>
____________
<p>
CONTINGENCY PLANS:
<p>
As always, a winter ascent in the White Mountains is a gamble. Trips
frequently get to treeline and have to turn around due to high winds.
Make sure that you are comfortable using an Ice-axe and crampons.
Also, make sure that you have tested out the gear well in advance of
the actual trip. A proper fit on crampons & snowshoes is absolutely
vital for your safety and the safety of others. If in doubt, consult
your trip leader well in advance of the trip, or as a last resort, at
the trail-head BEFORE starting the hike.
<p>
____________
<p>
EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES:
<p>
This trip will offer an opportunity for participants to test their
winter hiking, navigation, crampon/snowshoe, and above-treeline skills.
<p>
____________
<p>
TENTATIVE SCHEDULE:
<p>
Saturday, 8:15am: Meet at the Cog Railway base station (It is most efficient
to come up I-93 and then head toward Crawford Notch, look for Cog Railway
signs)<br>
Saturday, 8:30am: Start up th Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail<br>
Saturday, 4:30pm: Return to cars via Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail<br>
<p>
____________
<p>
GEAR:
<p>
By now, you should have a pretty good feel for what gear is expected
of you on a trip like this, but here's a checklist for your
convenience. Not all of this gear is explicitly required, but check
with me if you're afraid you might be lacking in a particular area.
<p>
Rental:
<ul>
   * Boot/crampon system that you have used previously with success.
      CRAMPONS REQUIRED.
   * Snowshoes
   * Back-Pack (should be big enough to carry all your things. Try
      not to stuff everything into a smaller bag!)
   * Sleeping Pad
</ul>
Clothing:
<ul>
   * Legs: non-cotton long underwear (wicking), fleece pants/shell
      (warm, wind/water-resistant top layer)
   * Body: non-cotton undershirt (wicking), fleece/wool warming layer
      (warming), water/wind-resistant shell (water/windproofing)
   * Gloves: non-cotton glove liners (wicking), warm gloves or

      overmitts (water/windproofing)
   * Face/Head: warm hat, face mask or balaclava, ski goggles
</ul>
FULL BODY COVER IS REQUIRED - NO EXCEPTIONS!
<p>
When it's all on, is there any exposed skin?  If there is, you need more
clothes or a better balaclava/face mask.
<p>
Feet: non-cotton liner socks (wicking), warm wool socks
      (warming), warm boots (waterproofing), crampons that fit your boots
      (Make sure they fit before you leave Boston!), gaiters (duct tape can
      be a great substitute)

   * Ice axe and/or hiking poles ICE AXE REQUIRED.
   * headlamp (Required!)
   * compass (Required!)
   * whistle (Required!)
   * trail food
   * space blanket (a good idea)
   * your leaders will provide you with a copy of the map
   * Bring your cell phone or two-way radio if you have one.
</ul>

<ul>

WEATHER:
<p>
The ground forecast for Bretton Woods, NH is cold with highs in the
low 20's (F) and light winds.  Conditions on the mountain will be
significantly colder, especially above treeline.  Remember that the
weather can change quickly and being prepared is key.
