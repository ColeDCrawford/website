<h2>What constitutes a "3-season hike"?</h2>
We consider any hike "3-season" if winter-conditions are not present.
Nominally ~April-October but this varies vastly year to year.
During shoulder seasons it is up to the winter safety committee to decide whether conditions are 3 season or winter.

<h2>Why does MITOC need 3-season hiking leaders?</h2>
MITOC runs all kinds of official hiking trips during the year outside of
winter -at monthy circuses, fall fling, lake george, Acadia and
many more - and all of these trips rely on safe, experienced hiking
leaders. It is important to create a group
of approved leaders that can lead 3-season hikes so all trips will go
smoothly, safely, and enjoyably for all participants.

<h2>What are the leader benefits?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Free gear rental from MITOC for trips led
<li>Gas subsidy at $0.13/mile ($60 max per trip, limit to 1 car, cannot be applied to trips used for course subsidy)

<li>Course subsidy for your Wilderness First Aid certification (WFA, WAFA, WFR, WEMT)
</ul>

<h2>Why should you become a leader?</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mitoc.mit.edu/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=258219">Come meet fellow enthusiasts!</a></br>

<li><a href="https://mitoc.mit.edu/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=47211">Help others enjoy the outdoors!</a></br>

<li><a href="https://mitoc.mit.edu/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=254720">Perform for your group on the summit!</a></br>
</ul>
<h2>How do I become a leader?</h2>

Please fill out the form below. This is an informal "resume" summarzing both 3 season hiking and outdoor leadership experience. We also require attend a ~30 minute safety seminar given throughout the year. Applicants
will be assigned a "Leader" or "Co-leader" rating based on the resume. Co-leaders will need to co-lead a trip with a full leader, but can be
considered for full-leader status after they have co-lead a trip or a few.

<h2>Can I lead a hike outside of the MITOC circuses?</h2>

Yes! If you are an approved leader you just need to notify the hiking
chair that you want to run an official
trip and announce it to mitoc@mit.edu.
