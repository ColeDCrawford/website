<h2>Why does MITOC need climbing leaders?</h2>
Climbing is inherently dangerous. We want to make sure our leaders are prepared to lead climbing trips safely.
This also allows provides mentorship for perspective climbing leaders to co-lead trips with leaders and to later become a full leader.

<h2>What are the leader benefits?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Free gear rental from MITOC for trips they lead, including ropes, quick draws, belay devices, and bouldering pads.
<li>Gas subsidy at $0.13/mile. ($60 max per trip, limit to 1 car, cannot be applied to trips used for course subsidy)
<li>Course subsidy for your Wilderness First Aid certification (WFA, WAFA, WFR, WEMT) for every 2 trips led
<li>Course subsidy for a Self Rescue course for every 2 trips led
</ul>

<b>Note:</b>Trips must be anounced (on the mailing list) as well as posted to
the trip signup at minimum 4 days before the trip goes out. These incentives
are intended to meet new people and teach new skills, not to simply have a
cheaper ride for your friends. Any trip not adhering to this criteria will not
be reimbursed (at the discresion of the climbing chair).

<b>Note:</b>The climbing chair must be notified of any trips lead as well as the number of participants.

<h2>How do I become a leader?</h2>
Please fill out the form below. This is an informal "resume" summarzing both
climbing and outdoor leadership experience. We also ask for 2 recommendations
from current climbing leaders. Applicants will be assigned a "Leader" or
"Co-leader" rating based on the resume. Co-leaders will need to co-lead a trip
with a full leader, but can be considered for full-leader status after they
have co-lead a trip or a few.

<h2>I want become a leader but I'm not ready yet</h2>
The best way to learn all the skills necessary is to co-lead some trips with leaders
or the climbing chair. Let us know if you're interested!
