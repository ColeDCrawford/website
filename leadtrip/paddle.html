<h2>What is the MITOC Paddling Leader Program?</h2>
The goal of the MITOC Paddling Leader Program is to provide the proper training
and resources to outstanding and dedicated members interested in leading or
co-leading paddling trips with MITOC. Each paddlesport (sea kayaking, white
water kayaking, canoeing, ect) offers a unique leadership development program
with specific requirements. Prospective leaders will work directly with the
chair of their respective paddlesport to further develop and demonstrate their
on-the-water leadership skills. Those who complete the program will be
designated as a paddling leader and will be welcome to lead/ co-lead MITOC
paddling trips and enjoy leader benefits.

<h2>What is expected of a MITOC Paddling Leader?</h2>

	<li>Successful completion of respective leader development program
	<li>Maintain current boathouse key holder status
	<li>Lead or co-lead two (2) MITOC paddling trips per calendar year
	<li>Assist the paddling chairs in dedicated boat maintenance sessions
	<li>Foster a sense of paddling community within MITOC by attending or hosting related events (trip reports, TRS, socials) throughout the year
</ul>

<h2>How do I become a leader?</h2>
Please fill out the form below and be sure to specify which paddle sport for
which you are interested in taking a leadership role. This is an informal
"resume" summarizing both your paddling experience and outdoor leadership
experience.  This form should be considered as a “sign-up” that will put you in
contact with the appropriate paddling chair so that you can get started with
your leadership development program. Prospective leaders will be assigned a
"Leader" or "Co-leader" rating based on their completion of the program.

<br /><br />
Q: I want become a leader but I'm not ready yet.
<br />A: The MITOC paddling community offers a wide array of trips, sessions, and
socials throughout the year. These are announced via email on the paddle list
and on the MITOC trip sign-up page. The best way to develop your paddling
skills and gain confidence as a prospective leader is to get involved! We’re
here to help so let us know if you're interested!
