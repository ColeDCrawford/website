<h1>Winter School Jan 2011</h1>
<p>
IAP is now, and with it comes plenty of opportunity for outdoor
trips in the snow.  MITOC's crash course in cold weather activities, Winter
School, begins January 4th and runs through the 30th.
</p>

<h2>Where can I find lectures?</h2>

<p>
Winter School 2011 Lectures are now being posted in <a href="2011/lectures/">here.</a>
</p>

<h2>What is Winter School?</h2>

<p>
Winter School is an annual IAP course presented by the members of MITOC.  Its
goal is to teach skills that facilitate the enjoyment of outdoor activities in
the winter.  During the month of January, participants attend lectures every
Tuesday and Thursday evening and spend time outdoors on the weekends that
follow.  Trips are offered at various intensity levels and include hiking,
snowshoeing, orienteering, cross-country skiing, back-country skiing, ice
climbing, winter camping, and mountaineering practice.
</p>

<h2>What is the format?</h2>

<p>
Lectures are held in room 35-225 from 7-9p.  They run every Tuesday and Thursday
from January 4 until January 27.  Lectures are geared toward a variety of skill
sets, ranging the basics of food and clothing to technical topics such ice
climbing and backcountry skiing.  The latter half of winter school will also
feature guest lectures from local wilderness experts.
</p>

<p>
Outdoor trips are held every Saturday and Sunday in January, and often involve
travel to New Hampshire's White Mountains.  Gear ranging from ice axes to
winter boots is available for rental.  A nominal fee is charged per trip, as
well as for rental items.
</p>

<h2>What is required to participate?</h2>

<p>
There is no pre-registration or immediate action needed.  However, all
participants are required to attend the first two lectures to be held at 7p on
January 4 and 6.  No previous winter experience is necessary.  Beginners are
welcome!
</p>

<h2>I'm going to miss one of the two mandatory lectures.  Am I still able to
participate?</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, there are no exceptions to the first week lecture attendance rule
at this time.  For safety purposes and out of fairness to the other students, we
require that all participants be present at the lectures on January 4 and 6.  We
don't currently have the resources to provide an alternate method of enrollment
for those that cannot attend.
</p>

<h2>I have done Winter School in the past.  May I participate again this year?</h2>

<p>
Yes, returning students are welcome to come refine their skills.  The first two
lectures are still mandatory, even if you've attended them before.
