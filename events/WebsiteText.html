		<h2 class="c2"><span class="c7">Overview</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span>The race will be held in and around the Charles
			River and MIT&rsquo;s campus on Sunday, September 22, 2013 from 9
			AM to 3 PM. Teams of 2 or 3 will run, row, climb and bike their way
			to as many checkpoints as possible during the 6 hour race. Each
			team will choose their own route through the course navigating with
			a map and compass (no GPS!) while optimizing their potential to
			earn points. Teams will earn additional points by solving
			challenging puzzles along the way. We&rsquo;ll use an
			open-ended</span> <span class="c6"><a class="c8" href=
				"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogaining">rogaine-style</a></span><span>&nbsp;scoring
			format to give teams maximal flexibility in developing their
			strategy. We&rsquo;ll cap off the day with an awesome BBQ and
			awards ceremony. Get excited!</span></p>

		<h2 class="c2"><span class="c7">Philosophy</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span>Adventure racing is an awesome team sport that
			involves a combination of physical stamina, technical skill,
			logistical management, analytical skills and team-work for success.
			Adventure racing often takes racers to distant wilderness, which
			can create a steep barrier to entry for newcomers so we wanted to
			bring that adventure to you in a manageable 6-hour sprint format!
			The Rugged Rampage is intended as a fun introduction to adventure
			racing for folks with all sorts of different
			skills/interests.</span></p>
		<h2 class="c2"><span class="c7">Scoring</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span>Checkpoints will be scattered across ~20 miles
			of trails and buildings around MIT and the Charles River.
			Checkpoints are marked by standard</span> <span class=
			"c6"><a class="c8" href=
				"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wGVr3bIm6ZM/T2Xr2SW47WI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/g88uSAPQWkU/s1600/control.jpg">
				orange and white controls</a></span><span>&nbsp;with a distinctive
			whole-punch used to mark the scoring passport each team will race
			with. You will punch your passport to prove you have successfully
			navigated to each checkpoint. Each checkpoint will be given a
			different point value dependent on its difficulty. Racers can
			determine which checkpoints to visit and the order of their
			traverse. The course is designed to have more checkpoints than any
			team will be able to visit (even</span> <span class="c5"><a class=
				"c8" href="http://web.mit.edu/matthewg/Public/adventures/">these
				guys</a></span><span>).This will make the course challenging for
			both experienced and novice teams alike.</span></p>
		<h2 class="c2"><span class="c7">Unique Features</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span>As this is an MIT race, we will include various
			puzzles along the course which teams can solve in order to earn
			additional points. None of these puzzles will be required, so if
			you get stumped you can move on, but they&rsquo;ll be a lot of fun
			and help you earn extra points. Further details about the nature of
			the puzzles will be provided at the race start, although the
			suggested</span> <span class="c6"><a class="c8" href=
