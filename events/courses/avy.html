<p>
Avalanches range in size and magnitude but can happen in many backcountry mountain situations. Whether skiing, hiking or climbing you should be aware of potential avalanche risks and how to identify potential avalanche situations. In the event that an avalanche does occur, proper training is the best hope for a rescue.
<br />
<br />
The club typically organizes an AIARE I style course after Winter School. This is a two-day course held in the Whites including both a class-room portion as well as some field work.

    <li>Avalanche Resuce using beacons, probes and shovels (typically in the field on Mt. Washington).
    <li>Many before / after pictures and videos
</ul>
