<p>
If your partner was hit by rockfall and hanging unconscious on the rope below,
would you know how to escape the belay and rappel down to them to administer
first aid? Could you do it quickly? Every climber should know how to deal with
an emergency in the vertical realm, but the truth is that most donâ€™t. Do you?

<h3>When</h3>
1 whole weekend. Trip will be annonced on the climbers@mit.edu mailing.
Interested trip leaders may take the course elsewhere and receive the same
reimbursment. As there is quite a bit of interested in this course we will
try to run one each spring and fall. If curious about the trip then please
contact the climbing chair: <a href="mailto:climbing-chair@mit.edu">climbing-chair@mit.edu</a>.

<h3>Where</h3>
Class will be held at Cathedral or White Horse Ledge in North Conway, NH. We
will stay at the Intervale cabin at night.

<h3>Who</h3>
Self rescue is strongly recommended for climbing leaders. Priority is given to
prospective climbing leaders, remaining spots are open to other MITOC members
first come first serve. This course is especially beneficial for those into or
getting into multi-pitch climbing.

<h3>Costs</h3>
If you become a MITOC Climbing Leader, MITOC will subsidize your self rescue
course. In order to obtain the subsidy, you MUST lead at least TWO trips. Last
year, the costs were $100 (Subsidized $50). Expect that this year's costs will
be similar.

<ul>Techniques:
<li>Friction hitches / load releasable knots
<li>Rescuing a fallen second
<li>Rescuing a fallen leader
<li>Escaping belay
<li>Load Transfers
<li>Rope Ascension
<li>Hauling systems (3-to-1 and 5-to-1)
</ul>

<h4>Supplies</h4>

	<b>Note:</b> Not much previous experience is required, however learning to tie a munter
mule is definitely beneficial ahead of time. This course is _highly_
recommended for anyone looking to join our climbing leaders program
( <a href="#leadtrip/climbing.html">Become a Climbing Leader</a> ). For participants in
the course I will provide some materials to review before the course so we
can focus on the higher level skills.
