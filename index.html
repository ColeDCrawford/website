    <h2>Winter School</h2>
    <p>
      Do you enjoy being outdoors but don't know what to do when the temperature drops? Do you live for summer but suffer in winter? Are you cooped up from November to March? Don't hide from the cold--celebrate winter! During IAP, participate in MIT Outing Club's Winter School, where you can have fun learning skills like cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, ice climbing and more. Winter School is MITOC's crash course in cold weather activities.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Winter School?</h2>
    <p>
      Winter School is an annual IAP course presented by the members of MITOC. Its goal is to teach the skills one needs to enjoy outdoor sports in the winter. During the month of January, participants attend lectures every Tuesday and Thursday evening and spend time outdoors during the weekends. Trips are offered at various levels of intensity and include hiking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, back-country skiing, ice climbing, winter camping, orienteering, and mountaineering.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What is the format?</h2>
    <p>
      Lectures are held every Tuesday and Thursday of IAP (Jan 10 â€“ Feb 2 this year). The first two lectures (Jan 10,12) are in room 34-101, and the remaining lectures (Jan 17-Feb 2) are in 35-225. Lectures are geared toward a variety of skill sets, ranging from the basics of food and clothing to technical topics such ice climbing and backcountry skiing. The second half of winter school will also feature guest lectures from regional wilderness experts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outdoor trips are held every Saturday and Sunday, and often involve travel to New Hampshire's White Mountains. Gear ranging from ice axes to winter boots is available for rent. A nominal fee of $7 is charged per trip, as well as for rental items.
    </p>

    <h2>What is required to participate?</h2>
    <p>
      There is no pre-registration or immediate action needed. However, all participants are required to attend the first two lectures to be held at 7p on the first Tuesday and Thursday in IAP (Jan 10 and 12) and to fill out the form below. No previous winter experience is necessary. Beginners are welcome!
    </p>
    
    <strong>I'm going to miss one of the two mandatory lectures. May I still participate?</strong>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, there are no exceptions to the first week lecture attendance rule. Because very important safety information is covered, we require that all participants be present at the first two lectures.
    </p>
    <strong>I have done Winter School in the past. May I participate again this year?</strong>
    <p> 
      Yes, returning students are welcome to come learn more skills. Remember that the first two lectures are mandatory, even if you've attended them before.
