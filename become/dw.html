<h1>BECOME A DESK WORKER</h1>
<p>
MITOC is made possible by office hours and office hours are made possible by wonderful volunteer desk workers. Give back to the community and become a desk worker! 
<p>
<h2>Who can be a desk worker?</h2>
Anyone who...
<ul>
<li>    Is generally available Wednesday and Thursday around 6-8pm
<li>    Is excited about gear, the outdoors, and MITOC!
</ul>
<h2>How and when can I be trained to work desk?</h2>
Simply contact the <a href="mailto:mitoc-desk@mit.edu">desk captain</a> to arrange to come by when they're working desk. 
Training doesn't take long and you learn most of it while working. 
<p>
We have mass training sessions when there's a high demand for desk workers (winter school and summer). Add yourself to any of our <a href="#jointrip/mailinglist.html">mailing lists</a> to stay informed.

<h2>What are the benefits of working desk?</h2>
<ul>
<li>   Be the face of MITOC and help out members excited about going outdoors
<li>    Giving back to the MITOC community which wouldn't be possible without office hours
<li>    Free/discounted gear rentals
