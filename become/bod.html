Board of directors (or BOD for short) are the leadership behind MITOC. Our meeting are held monthly and are open to the MITOC community, please check the calendar for future meetings or contact our <a href="mailto:mitoc-owner@mit.edu">president</a>. 
<p>
Being a MITOC officer is fun and interesting. First of all, you meet a great number of interesting people, and gain a better understanding of how the club works. 
Especially new members benefit from this arrangement, since you will have a chance to go on many more trips, as well as organize some of your own. 
It will give you a great opportunity to work on your own and to shape the club the way you want it to. 
The club usually follows the policies of the most active members, and most of the club expansion effort is directed into the areas of greatest activity. 
<p>
Interestingly, the club is one of the few financially self-sufficient student organizations on campus, earning its operating budget through gear rentals and book sales. 
As an officer of MITOC, you can bring about changes that will directly benefit a large part of the MIT community. 
You can take on responsibility for large events, such as Winter School lecture series, or the Circuses. 
<p>
These experiences are certainly more valuable than just resume stuffers.
