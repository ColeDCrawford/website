<h2>Who leads TRS?</h2>
Technical Review Sessions (TRS) are <strong>review sessions</strong> not a lecture. 
Generally session leaders have taken the <a href="#events/courses.shtml">course</a> related to the topic reviewed 
or are presenting miscellaneous topics of interest. 
As a leader, you won't be expected to know everything on the topic but merely to guide a review session 
or discussion. 
If you're feeling a bit fuzzy on a topic because you took the course a while ago, 
TRS is a great opportunity to review the material in preparation for a running a session.

<h2>How to lead TRS?</h2>
Simply contact the <a href="mailto:trs-chair@mit.edu">TRS chair</a> to schedule a session or add yourself
to the leaders <a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/mitoc-trs">mailing list</a>.
<p>
We encourage leaders to make the session as interactive as possible such as practicing medical scenarios for 
first aid or practicing rope work for self resuce/mountaineering/climbing.

<h2>Resources</h2>
We retain an archive of previous TRS (see left). They're a great resource, please use them!

<h2>Benefits?</h2>
This is a great way to 
practice skills that would otherwise be hard to retain after just a 1 weekend course.
It's also a  great way to meet fellow MITOCers outside the mailing list and large trips.
