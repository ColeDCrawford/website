Does MITOC owe you money? Please follow these directions to get reimbursed.
<h2>Extra notes:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>DO NOT pay more than $5000. We have to use a requisition for large orders.
	<li>You can get reimbursed for any amount up to the amount listed on your proof of payment not including tax.
	<li>You can submit multiple receipts at the same time. Please don't submit four RFPs at once when you could submit one RFP with four line items.
	<li>Any time you receive a physical receipt it MUST be dropped off in the office.
	<li>If you purchased from Amazon, they will send you two emails and you need both to get reimbursed. The order confirmation has your itemized receipt and the shipping notification has your proof of payment.
</ul>
