<h2>GNARMPFSK March 1995</h2>

<pre>
Hello everyone interested in MITOC goings on.  In lieu of a
full-fledged issue of the club's newsletter, GNARMPFSK, here is a
listing of some announcements.

1) ANNUAL GENERAL ELECTIONS AND PIZZA & ICECREAM BASH

    On Thursday,  March 16th, starting at 6:30 p.m.  in the MITOC  office,
    W20-461, the club will have its  annual elections of  officers and BOD
    members.   Everyone  in  the world (yes, you!) is eligible for most of
    these positions,  so come out  and get involved.  As a bonus, the club
    will feed you tonnes of excellent pizza  and Tosci's  icecream.  (Yes,
    vegetarian pizza too!  There's one catch on the  ice-cream, though: we
    won't supply utensils, so  bring your huge  coffee mug cup and a spoon
    from home.)

    Posts   to  be  filled   include:  Presidents,  Secretary,  Treasurer,
    Equipment Manager, Cabin  Managers,  Rental  Manager,  Boating  Chair,
    Climbing Chair, Books Manager, and Board of Directors Members.

    If  you are interested  in the kinds of  activities MITOC is here for,
    you will find that taking  one of these positions is  by far the  best
    way (for many people, the only way to really get around to it!) to get
    involved, meet  people to trip with, and learn  outdoor  skills.  That
    is,  you  don't even  need  specialized  experience to run  for  these
    positions ...

2) ANNUAL SPRING CIRCUS!!

     O.K.,  what  does it mean that Passover, Easter, Patriot's Day,  and a
     partial eclipse of a full moon all fall on the same weekend?

     Time for Spring Circus!!!  This year Spring Circus will most likely be
     held  at the club's new and  beautiful Intervale III Cabin.  Patriot's
     Day is the 17th of April.  Circus will be held from Friday, April 14th
     to  whenever  (giving  you  still  enough  time  to  tool.)   Come and
     celebrate  whatever you want  with hiking, climbing, canoeing, eating,
     relaxing, and religious rituals.  Contact imapilot@mit.edu for info.

3) Spring IOCA Conference

    There are lots of other cool Outing Clubs  out there.  Many of them in
    the Northeast get together as the  IOCA,  the  Intercollegiate  Outing
    Club Association.  MITOC used to be more involved with IOCA activites,
    but has been a little slack lately.  Over April  21 - 23, 1995 IOCA is
    having a spring conference (read  "party"),  hosted by UConn.   If you
    are    at   all   interested   in   attending   it,   please   contact
    "mitoc-owner@mit.edu" for more info; it sounds like a blast!

4) MITOC Auction: Tents, External frame packs, Skis, Snowshoes

    The  monthly general  meeting  in  April, which will occur on  Monday,
    April 3rd,  1995, will consist of something  new...  an auction of old
    equipment (and parts.)  Various gear will be  sold or  given  away, so
    show up promptly after rental hours.  The event will begin at 18:30.

5) MITOC Desk Workers: FREE RENT

    You may  not  have  known that  you  can also finance your outings  by
    running MITOC's rental  desk.  This is now  done with the  help of new
    software.  You  get  one day's free  rental  for each  office hour you
    work.   Contact  cpbarrin@mit.edu  for   info  and  upcoming  training
    sessions.

6) Camelot Keyholder / Work Trip: May 21, 22, 1995

    The Camelot Cabin manager will  be running a Keyholder  Checkout trip.
    If  you  are interested in  using Camelot  Cabin,  one  of  the club's
    properties and cabins near Plymouth, New Hampshire, you can  check out
    the cabin key for yourself, and can even lead groups to Camelot, after
    you have been on this trip.  Of course, the weekend  includes  lots of
    fun as well  as a bit of work and training!  Contact stuart@ll.mit.edu
    for info.

7) Climbing classes

    The first official climbing classes  scheduled so far will be over the
    weekend of July 15-16th, with a preparatory day  trip  to Hammond Pond
    on  the  8th  of   July.   Contact  spl@meceng.coe.neu.edu  for   more
    information.  Of  course,  you can probably  find  someone to take you
    climbing  long before  then  if you want to learn; e.g. try posting to
    "climbers@mit.edu".

8)  Kayak Rolling practice -- MIT swimming pool

    As recently announced by the Water Chair, gideon@ai.mit.edu : 
       I have coordinated with Evan Weis who runs intra (or inter) mural
       water polo that we can use the small pool tuesdays and thursdays
       from 5-7 pm. There is no charge (but you might need an athletic
       card) and you can use club boats if you like (no charge for that
       either). There is room for only about 3-4 people to practice
       rolling but I doubt that will be a problem.

9) Boating Trip

    Gideon will also be leading a boating trip  over the  weekend of April
    29th / 30th. Announcements will be made to <sub><img src="../../mitocmainlist.jpg"></sub>

10) Other Trips

    All it takes is a bit of initiative.  Go ahead and start  organizing a
    trip, even if you will want someone more  experienced along  .. you'll
    be able  to find them  and  lots more interested people.  Feel free to
    use the club's mailing lists, <sub><img src="../../mitocmainlist.jpg"></sub>, "climbers(at)mit(dot)edu", and
    "paddle(at)mit(dot)edu" to solicit participants / leaders.  Actually, if  you
    like, we will help you organize it, give your trip participants half -
    price on rental, and give you (the leader) free gear rental.   If  you
    need help, email "mitoc-owner@mit.edu".

11) Check out the club's WWW page.

    From Athena, just type from the Athena% prompt,
                 add mitoc

12)  Have nothing to do for the summer?

     Check out the  MITOC  bulletin board outside our office at W20-461 for
     summer  job opportunities.  You  can get  a job  a  number  of  places
     working for the AMC, Mass State Parks, etc, etc.  And if you  might be
     at  all interested in low-paying  wilderness  / conservation  -related
     jobs across North America,  definitely check out  what the  S.C.A. 
     (Student Conservation Association) has found this year (also posted 
     on the bulletin board).

13) Here's a want ad ... (?!)

    Looking  for  a place  to live  from  May 1st.  Graduate  student  and
    software engineer  wants  to share  an  apartment. 26,  Male,  single,
    interests  include   throwing   boomerangs,  folk   dancing,   HIKING,
    BACKPACKING, playing the  flute,  pets  ok.  Preferred  locations  are
    Sommerville,  Cambridge,  Boston  etc.    Prefer  students  or  recent
    graduates.
    
    If you  have a place to share or  are  interested to look for  a place
    send me e-mail kanna@world.std.com
    
14) Spring break climbing / skiing trip

    There will  likely be a  club trip leaving  MIT on the evening of  the
    25th  of  March.  We  will  head to  Intervale  III  and spend  Sunday
    backcountry / tele skiing and / or possibly snowclimbing to and in the
    Gulf of Slides on Mt  Washington, NH.  There is some space already for
    the ride  up,  and  the option of  a ride back  on Monday night  (with
    nothing  organized yet for Monday day).  This is appropriate for those
    who  have  graduated from  MITOC's  Winter  School,  or  have  similar
    experience.  For info, email "spl@meceng.coe.neu.edu".

15) Gunks climbing buttons

    If the club were to buy some buttons for entry to the Mohonk Reserve, would
    anyone want to rent them?  How many days this year do you think you would
    rent them? (e.g. 3 - 4 $ / day...).  If there is enough interest, the
    club will buy some.  Email cpbarrin@mit.edu to vote.
