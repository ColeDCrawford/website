<h1>Winter School 2003</h1>
<A NAME="Intro"></A>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Every year MITOC organizes a set of lectures, demonstrations, and
winter trips know collectively as Winter School.  This year the
tradition will continue with a variety of lectures and a multitude
of trips for all skill levels.

<P>The lectures cover such topics as proper clothing and gear, food,
snow shelters, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, mountaineering, and
more.  Each weekend during IAP we organize multiple trips to the White
Mountains to practice the skills learned in the lectures.  You can
<A href="../rentals/rentals.html">rent</a> most of the technical
equipment needed for these trips from MITOC.
                                                        
<P>There is no charge for winter school and you do 
      not need to register in advance. Just show up to the weekly lectures! 
      However, to enhance everyone's safety and enjoyment of the mountains we do 
      require that you attend all of the mandatory lectures in order to 
      participate on our weekend trips.

      <P><FONT size=2>No enrollment limit, no advance sign up</FONT> <BR><FONT 
      size=-1>Participants welcome at individual sessions <B>(series)</B></FONT> 
      <BR><FONT size=-1>Prereq: none</FONT> <BR><BR>Introduction to 
      self-propelled wilderness winter travel. Two nights per week of lecture, 
      plus trips every weekend for people who have been to the classes (rental 
      gear available). Topics progress from daytrips to winter camping and 
      mountaineering; will cover food, clothing, and travel by snowshoes, 
      crampons and skis. Talks will include info on winter natural history, 
      weather, map &amp; compass skills, self-arrest, safety, and cold weather 
      injuries. All levels of experience welcome. NOTE: THE FIRST SEVERAL 
      LECTURES ARE CUMULATIVE AND MANDATORY FOR PARTICIPATION IN WINTER 
      TRIPS!</P>
      <H2>Trips</H2>
      <P>There will be trips every weekend, based on the materials&nbsp;built on 
      the previous lectures.&nbsp; The sign ups will occur on Thursday.&nbsp; 
      There will be office hours on Thrusday right after lectures to obtain the 
      material for the weekends.&nbsp; Transportation and leaders are usually 
      the limiting factors, so if you have friends with cars, encourage them to 
      come.&nbsp; If you have friends with some winter/cold experience, 
      encourage them to talk to use at <A 
      href="mailto:mitoc-owner@mit.edu">mitoc-owner@mit.edu</A> to lead or 
      co-lead trips.</P>

<p> In order to participate in a
weekend trip, you need to attend all mandatory lectures up to and
including the last Thursday before the trip weekend.  Individual
trip leaders have the final decision if they do not feel a person
has the proper knowledge or preparation for a trip.

<p>If you are interested in leading a MITOC trip, please contact
<A href="mailto:mitoc-owner@mit.edu"><FONT 
      color=#0000ff>mitoc-owner@mit.edu</FONT></a>.

<p>The below schedule of trips is very tentative, and <b>not
complete</b>.  These trips could change, and there will be many other
trips announced on Thursday lectures.

<p>Do NOT email the trip leaders to sign up for the 
      trips. Trip signup will be done in person at Winter School letures. Trip 
      leader email addresses are provided in case you have questions about the 
      trips.</p>

<tr>
<td>Fri 1/24 - Sat 1/25</td><td><b>Extreme Sledding</b><br>
Led by Jason Lapenta (lapenta_jm@yahoo.com), David Comi and Yoko Miyata. <br>
This trip is in no way considered safe. Like
rock-climbing and ice-climbing it carries serious 
risks, like running into trees, being buried by 
avalanches, dying of exhaustion, sliding off 
mountains and freezing to death. This trip is for 
people experienced with dealing with long hikes, 
extreme cold, have the proper gear and are familiar 
with it's limits, can go zero exposure (mask
goggles, etc), are not afraid or heights or going 
fast down steep slopes or weaving between trees 
on a single track trails. Must be prepared for 
hiking all day and all night to go sledding.
<br>
Drive up Friday Night, buy sled. Make a base camp at
Intervale. Depending on weather and conditions we 
will sled near Mt. Washington and possible Wildcat Mtn. 
There is no way to set a location because it is 
highly weather dependent.
<br>
Saturday we will sled all day and into the night. 
Coming back late. Sunday will depend on how whooped 
we are on what we do but probably more sledding. 
<br>
I don't think mouse boots are going to cut it
for this trip, but I've never hiked in mouse 
boot. What do you more experienced leaders think?
<br>
Gear:

Keep packs light for fun sledding.

Luge sled,
Full winter gear,
headlamp,
Two insulated nalgenes,
Gorp,
Insulated winter boots sorrels or equivalent,
* Crampons w/prior experience,
Gaiters,
* ice axe, 
* pack with ax loops.<br>

Endurance to keep moving in the cold all day.
Above treeline experience.
Self arrest experience.

<td>Sun 1/26</td><td><b>Beginners/Lazybums/Injured athletes XC minitrip </b><br>

Equipment: XC skis</td>
