MITOC Winter School Skills Trip in Tuckerman Ravine - Jan. 30, 1999
During the last weekend of IAP, six winter school students took to the famed
Tuckerman's Ravine to try out their newly acquired winter skills.    All had
Mouse boots or plastic boots, crampons, ice ax and helmet.  After a cozy
night's stay at Intervale, the group headed up the Tuckerman Ravine trail.
Avalanche warnings were low; conditions were more favorable at Tuckerman's
than at Huntington's Ravine, the group's original destination.

After breezing past a series of skiers and other hikers, the groups was
rewarded for its efforts by having the Ravine largely to themselves.  Trip
leader Sue R. taught a  variety of self-arrest techniques.  Fellow trip
leader and staff photographer Hector B. set-up a snow anchor and rope and
observed many of the proceedings from the comfort of his harness.  One
important winter skill perfected by all - the art of body sledding.
