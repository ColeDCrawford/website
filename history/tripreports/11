NOTE: If you're looking for a hike for people-of-varying-fitness, you
probably don't want to climb a mountain anyway - asking people who
lead sedentary lives to perform the equivalent of walking up 100
flights of stairs is just plain cruel.  Look at the book "50 Hikes in
Massachusetts" - which I bought at the Coop - for flat, meandering
walks instead.

To everyone looking for an easy-to-moderate hiking trip within 2 hours
of Boston: Consider Mt. Monadnock, in Jaffrey New Hampshire (north of
Gardner/Fitchburg - it's shown on most Massachusetts state maps).

LEVEL: Well, it gets steep, and there's a lot of scrambling over
rocks, but you can get up the thing in 2-3 hours if it's not raining.  It's
short (3125 feet).

BANG-FOR-THE-BUCK: High!  There are spectacular views for the entire
top third of the mountain, thanks to a forest fire in the early 19th
century.  There *is* a parking fee - $5 a car? I can't remember.  If
you go up the AMrlboro trail, you'll avoid the fee, but you won't get
a map.

CONVENIENCE: Depending on your respect for the law, it's a 1 1/2 - 2
hour drive from Boston.  The place is on the map, and there's a ranger
station that sells candy and trinkets, and gives away maps.

FALL COLOR: Was already setting in last Saturday - several brightly
colored sugar maples were in evidence.

EXTRA ADDED BONUS: You can stop and pick apples on the way back.
CHeck out the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture web page for
orchard locations and hours.  Only go to Honeypot Hill in Stow if you
want to experience factory farming for yourself.

SUPER SPECTACULAR ADDED BONUS: EAch year, in early September, there is
a modern dance performance on top of the mountain - which is
inaccessible by car.  I was quite impressed.
