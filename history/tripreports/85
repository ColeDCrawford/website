Subject: Trip Report: the Merril Ski Trail in the Moosilauke Ravine

Jae Roh, Pam Campus, Cathy Lavelle and I skied the Merril Ski trail at
the base of Moosilauki this past Sunday. The snow conditions were
excellent, with only one small stream not frozen closed. 

The only obstacles in our path were some blow downs from a storm, about
a week earlier. If you can bring a small saw for the branches you would
be able to clear the path quickly, since all but one of the blow down
was not high enough so we could ski under. Some additional pruning with
a small saw would allow you to glide under most of them.

A local informed us that the carriage road to the summit has been
cleared of blow downs and can now be skied (or snowmobiled) to the
summit.
