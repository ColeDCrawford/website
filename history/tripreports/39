	If you haven't considered it, the Wonderland Trail around Mt Rainier
is a really nice hike.  5-6 nights would only be possible for doing the whole
trail if you are very fast hikers.  Most people do it in around 10 days - it
is a 93 mile hike with 21000 feet of total elevation gain.  A friend of 
mine and I hiked the trail last summer and I put together a web
page with a very long and detailed trip report.  It is at 
http://scv.bu.edu/~aarondf/rainier/  If you get interested and have other
questions, let me know.  We also briefly visited North Cascades and Olympic
but didn't have time to hike in them.  Rainier was really wonderful, though.
