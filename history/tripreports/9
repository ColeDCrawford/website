Subject: Trip Report: Rescue Class/Kennebec



Rescue Workshop: Thursday 25th and Friday 26th

Matt and I attended a Swiftwater Rescue Course taught by Charlie 
Walbridge and Dennis ---.  The other six participants were rafting
guides in Maine.  A major focus of the course was getting comfortable
swimming and wading (yes wading!) in fast moving water.  (WARNING,
WARNING, don't try this without expert instruction). These skills 
allow fast access to a victim when setting up fancy rope work would
take too long.  We also trained with rescue life jackets that allow
a rescuer to be belayed out into the current, but still have a
quick release if the rope pulls the rescuer under water (a number
of rescuers have been killed by entangled belay lines).
We then did some mock rescues.  All in all it was a great course.

It was an eye opener to me that an effective rescue of an entrapped 
swimmer/boater is likely to require 3 trained people to be
carried off quickly, effectively, and with minimal risk to
the rescuers.  If only one person in a group is trained, they
may have to give others flash training on the spot.
I would encourage anyone who plans to spend
much time white water boating to get at least some minimal
training.  If you ever need a rescue it will most likely have
to come from the others in your group.


Kennebec: Saturday 28th

On Saturday some of the guides in the workshop had a day off and
Matt and I ran the Kennebec with them and some of their friends.
The upper gorge on the Kennebec is a IV/V run (which can turn into
a 3 mile swim).  Jeremy (one of the guides) lent me a duckie 
(inflatable kayak) since I would be seriously tempting fate if
I tried to make the run in my kayak.  We also had Matt and Jeremy
in kayaks, a 2 person cataraft, and a 3 person raft.

The river level was 6000 cfs and an awesomely fun time was had by
all.  The upper gorge has lots of continuous rapids with big waves,
powerful currents and eddy lines, but lots of big eddies to stop
and rest in.  At Magic, the biggest drop, we sent the cataraft down
first so they could act as safety boat.  The only problem was that
they were the ones that filpped!

The duckie was great fun to paddle.  They are highly maneuverable
and very stable.  When we reached Carry Brook we collected some 
more people for the rest of the
trip and I traded the duckie for my kayak.  The section from
Carry Brook down starts with a long III/IV rapid and then has lots
of class II rapids followed by a few miles of I/swiftwater to the Forks.
This makes for a great intermediate run, but the first rapid might
swamp an open boat at higher levels.

I highly reccommend both sections of the river, but make sure your
party is competent and self sufficient.
