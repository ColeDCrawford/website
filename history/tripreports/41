Here are some photos from a wonderful weekend trip to Acadia National
Park.  On the trip we went hiking, rock climbing and sea kayaking.
One of the best features of the trip was that the rock climbing was
done on ocean facing cliffs, so the sea kayakers could paddle by and
watch.  And it goes both ways -- the rock climbers were treated to
the sight of a sea kayak capsizing!  Too bad we don't have a photo of
that...

<em>On our marathon hike we had the clever
idea of following this pretty stream back to the road.  Little did we
know that we'd end up walking through a muddy marsh!</em><p>
