Subject: trip report: Boston->New York AIDSride 6


After last year's AIDSride was cancelled by a hurricane, I signed up
again almost immediately.  Here are some photos and a rambling
description of the event.  (Be sure to let all the pictures load - the
shot of the pit stop 2 crew at the end is not to be missed)

If you enjoy biking, this is simply THE event to do.  It's a lot of fun,
very well organized, and has an utterly unique atmosphere to it.  Only
361 days to go until AIDSride 7!

see you there
