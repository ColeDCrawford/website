Here's something I wrote a while back that may help people find the
place.

The wave at Cohasset
--------------------

The wave at Cohasset is formed by the flow of tidal water into a river
called "the Gulf" or "Musquashicut Brook" on my map.  It's a good
place to practice surfing, and is quite safe.  If you flip, there
aren't any rocks to worry about, and you get swept into a large calm
pool.  The biggest worry is all of the children who jump from the
bridge!  This bridge is on Border St, and connects Gulf "Island"
(which is just an outcrop of the mainland) to Government "Island"
(which is another outcrop), and the put-in is on the east side of
the bridge on the north side of Border St.  You can park here to
unload boats, but you'll get a fine if you leave your car there
for a long time.  The Harbormaster said that it's ok to park on
the north side of Border St. west of the bridge.

Timing:

  Today, high tide in Boston (as found on the front page of the Boston
Globe, for example) was 6:01 pm.  Because the water forming the wave
has to come through Cohasset Harbor, the times are different there.
For example, I would guess that the water was stationary at around 2
pm, about two hours later than Boston's low tide.  The wave was most
fun from between 3:30 and 5.  These times are approximate, but you can
use them and the Boston Globe to determine when to show up on other
days.  If you arrive too early, that just means you have time to
practice your roll.

  Speaking of which, I should mention that it's best to have a roll if
you go to Cohasset.  There's no danger if you don't, but if you bail
out you get swept into a large pool and have a bit of a swim to do.
And the wave *will* flip you --- it's a very hard wave to surf.  I
should also mention that the water can sometimes be cold, so you might
want to bring along a wetsuit (or polypro) and a windbreaker or dry
top.  And of course, wear a helmet.

  Here's an excerpt from something someone else wrote about the wave.
(Sorry, I forget who.)

   It is very difficult to ride the wave, and it helps very much to be
   taught some tricks.  The current is very swift, and can quickly take
   you into the middle of the pond.  It is not at all dangerous, but if
   you have to bail out then you're in for a long swim which is made
   easier if someone still in a boat helps you.  A roll makes things
   *much* easier.
   
   To ride the wave, start in the eddy on the river's right hand side.
   Aim close to upstream and enter the current with some speed in the
   trough that is furthest upstream.  Don't forget to lean downstream!
   Quickly make sure you are pointing directly upstream (can use the
   paddle as a rudder on the left hand side) and try leaning back a bit.

  There's a French bakery on Main St., near it's intersection with
Elm, and across the street is a service station with a restroom.
