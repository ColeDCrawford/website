Although it is not the most rustic site in these parts, Borderland
State Park near Sharon, Massachusetts has a delightful small lake full
of flowering lily pads and minnows.  Boating is allowed, but swimming
is not, which means that the place is virtually deserted* - but still
beautiful - on glorious summer days, like yesterday.  The canoes** that we 
and our friends used were the only vessels on the place the entire afternoon.
It is an excellent place to spend a lazy afternoon.  There are several miles
of trails (many open to mountain bikes - for good or ill), an amusing-looking
mansion, and gardens on the property as well.

The place is about an hour from Boston:  call the park at (508) 238-6566 for
directions.

* Well, it wasn't deserted yesterday, because Scott and I were getting
married then, but we really didn't see anyone else.  The rangers
assured us that the place would be fairly empty, and they were right.
** Thank you, Chris and Liz.
