Those participants who signed up for a challenging beginner hike were
certainly well rewarded.  The trip followed the Whitehouse Trail from
the base, joining the Liberty Spring Trail after 0.8 mile.  The
Liberty Spring trail ran for 0.6 miles before joining the Flume Slide
trail.  From there it was a 3.3 mile hike to the summit of Mt. Flume,
at 4328'.  As we neared the summit the terrain became progressively
steeper, icier, and more challenging.  Those new to crampons and those
who hadn't used them in a while learned to place as many points as
possible squarely on the ice when climbing.  As we climbed we seemed
to acquire new members to our party it was remarked in jest that
MITOC's famed return rate would actually rise above 100%.  Jokes
stopped when we reached the Mt. Flume Summit and were suddenly treated
to a spectacular view.  Visible were Mt. Washington, Mt. Garfield, and
even Mt. Monadnock to the south.  The vertiginous view down Flume
Slide was remarkable. 

From Mt. Flume Summit we followed the Franconia Ridge Trail for 1.1
miles to Mt. Liberty Summit at 4459 feet elevation.  We then followed
the Liberty Spring Trail for 3.2 miles, joining up with the Whitehouse
trail.  The descent was somewhat icy in spots, and those who had
decided to take off their crampons hoping to descend faster suffered a
nasty fall or two on the ice.  Another 0.8 miles later we were at the
parking lot.  The sky was startlingly clear, offering a view of the
milky way and a crescent, silver moon.  Quite a trip.   

The post-hike dinner was at Elvio's, where pizzas and calzone were
scarfed down ravenously.
