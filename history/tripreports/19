Hello MITOC,

Jesse Darley and I maintained the MITOC tradition of attempting a presi-
dential traverse on President's day.  My original post has disappeared
into the net (my apoologies in advance when it reappears in your mailbox
ages and ages hence), so I am sending out a short summary.  The details
have started to fade but the trip report is correct in its essentials.

Evening of 2/16:  Intervale:  3 ft of snow on ground, trail to cabin 
  broken out but uneven walking; 10F and absolutely still, high, thin
  overcast and 3/4 full moon.  

Morning of 2/17:  Crawford Notch 7:45 am:  carrying crampons, ice axe, 
  snow shoes, 3.5l hot water.  Crawford Path well broken out, excellent
  and rapid hiking possible.  

                  Arrive at summit of Clinton/Pierce 9:30; clear, sunny,
  10F, 20 knot winds; trail becomes sketchy over windpacked snow.  Cloud
  in Eisenhower/Pierce Col--developing lenticular? (note windy forecast)
  --snowshoe hare signs in krumholtz.

                  Missed switchback at base of Eisenhower; meteorite in Gulf 
  of Slides, caused fires and "cloud" (good-bye only native US popu-
  lation of Hot-headed Ice-borers); no sign of developing weather on Mt.
  Washington.

                  Where is Lakes of the Clouds Hut?; signage rimed over;
  arrive at Hut 12:30 for lunch; don crampons, get cold, decide not enough 
  time to finish traverse.

                  Head uphill to summit (trail?); overcircled by raven;
  windpacked snow gives way to ice on windward side on ridge; accelerate
  as we near the summit of Mt. W--recovery from lunch?  elation at reaching
  goal?  No:  electro-gravitic field from ersatz "asteroid".

                  Mt. Washington summit:  0F, < 25 mph winds, party of 
  aliens dressed as New Hampshire schoolteachers.  Head alien introduces
  herself as "Marsha" and asks us if we would like to "join";  uncertainty;
  alien website:  http://www.mountwashington.org.

                  Descent on Tuckerman Ravine Trail/Lion's Head winter trail.
  Jesse teaches simple avalanche forecast method.  Low avalanche danger on 
  windpacked snow above Lion's Head.  High avalanche danger on crust-topped
  powder at and below Lion's Head.

                  Lion's Head winter trail steep and twisty, follows 
  Hot-headed Ice Borer slide--fun-loving Ice Borers relocated to Tuckerman 
  Ravine--trail could be very difficult if icy but much fun when snow-covered;
  arrive at Pinkham Notch 5:30pm. clear, still, 10F.


Analysis--late start, good decision making, excellent hike in wonderful
weather!

Thanks to Harold Payson for shuttling our car.
