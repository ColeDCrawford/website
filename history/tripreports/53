Yes yes yes!!!!! I went on the perfect overnight backpacking trip.  It and
many others can be found in the "Best of the Appalachian Trail" book at
Eastern Mountain Sports -- near the Star on Commonwealth Ave. I just leant
mine to someone but if you can't get it I can try to get it from them.
 
The hike we did was a "moderate" -- but it was beautiful!!!  It is the
"Gentian
pond" hike in the book, in northern NH, not quite 3 hurs away.I can't
remember the directions to the trailhead--they're in the book-- but
the first day you take one of a couple of trails up the mountain (whose
name
I also forgot--really bad with names).  The trail we took followed a river
the
whole way up the mountain, and there were "Giant Falls" along side.  When
you reach the summit you pass 2 large mountain ponds--moss pond and
another
I can't recall the name of before coming to Gentian Pond.  There is an
AMC (FREE!) shelter here with what's reported to be one of the best views
of any shelter on the AT--you can see zillions of mountains--but the
real treat is Gentian pond, a perfectly still and clear mountain lake
surrounded by thick trees, from which water exits through a waterfall,
which
is the only sound around.  This is a BEAUTIFUL hike every minute!  THe
shelter is neat and nice, and there's a number of tent platforms
higher up.  It's not especially populated (we were there on a Sat night
in July and still there were just a pair of guys staying at the shelter;
we were up at the tent platforms, alone.
 
I REALLY recommend this!!!  Oh, depending on the route you take up/down,
itcan be from 6-10 miles each way.  I recommend getting the book and a
trail
map from EMC--they have all the AT documents there that you can see on
their website.
