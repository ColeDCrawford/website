<h1>Overview of Winter School</h1>
<H3><A NAME="Intro"></A>Introduction</H3>

If you are interested in learning how to enjoy the outdoors in the
winter, then MITOC's Winter School, offered during IAP every January,
is for you.  Winter School combines lectures (twice a week for four
weeks) with weekend trips to the mountains.

<P>The lectures cover such topics as proper clothing and gear, food,
snow shelters, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, mountaineering, and
more.  They are designed for people who have no previous winter
camping experience -- beginners are especially invited, though even
seasoned outdoorspeople will likely find new material to learn. Talks
are often accompanied by slides from MITOC members' expeditions around
New England and around the world.

<P>Each weekend during IAP we organize multiple trips to the White Mountains
to practice the skills learned in the lectures. On the first weekend are
day hikes, while on the later weekends we go on overnight trips, culminating
in an attempt on Mt. Washington, the highest peak in the Northeastern US.

<P>Our lectures will cover all the details of the equipment needed for
winter activities. You can rent most of the technical equipment needed
for these trips from MITOC. We have sleeping bags, tents, snowshoes,
skis, crampons, boots, etc... See our rental list for a complete list
of equipment for rent. You will be required to provide your own
clothing. More details will be given during the lectures but the basic
idea is to layer clothing, avoid cotton at all costs, and stay
dry. This requires a good polypro (or similiar) underwear layer, an
insulating (or a couple!) layer, and a wind / rain layer. Good warm
hats and gloves / mits are a necessity and should have a Gore-Tex or
similar waterproofing layer.

<P>There is no charge for winter school and you do not need to
register in advance. Just show up to the weekly lectures!  However, to
enhance everyone's safety and enjoyment of the mountains we do
require that you attend all of the lectures in order to participate in
our weekend trips.  (Trips usually have small charges associated with
them, to cover costs of gear rental, gas, food, land use fees, etc.)

<H3><A NAME="murray"></A>Murray Hamlet</H3>
One of the major attractions of Winter School is the annual lecture by
<B>Dr. Murray Hamlet</B> of the US Army on "Cold Weather Injuries." Dr.
Hamlet gives an informative, entertaining, and not a little disturbing
talk on how to understand and prevent cold weather injuries such as frostbite
and hypothermia. His slides are truly a must-see, and we have compiled a few
related <a href="../events/hamlet.html">links</a> for your convenience.
