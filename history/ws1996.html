If you are interested in learning about how to enjoy the outdoors in the 
winter, then MITOC's Winter School, offered over IAP, is for you. 
Winter School combines lectures (twice a week for four weeks) with 
weekend trips to the mountains.
<p>

The lectures cover such topics as proper clothing and gear, food, snow
shelters, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, mountaineering, and
more. They are designed for people who have no previous winter camping
experience--beginners are especially invited. Talks are often accompanied
by slides from MITOC members' expeditions around New England and around
the world. 
<p>


Each weekend during IAP we organize multiple trips to the White Mountains
to practice the skills learned in the lectures. On the first
weekend are day hikes, while on the later weekends we go on 
overnight trips, culminating in an attempt on Mt. Washington, the
highest peak in the Presidentials.

<p>
One of the major attractions of Winter School is the annual lecture by
<strong>Dr. Murray Hamlet</strong> of the US Army on 
"Cold Weather Injuries."
Dr. Hamlet gives an informative, entertaining, and not a little 
disturbing talk on how to understand and prevent cold weather injuries
such as frostbite and hypothermia. His slides are truly a must-see.
Watch this space, or the MITOC board in the infinite corridor, for
the date and time of Dr. Hamlet's lecture this January.
