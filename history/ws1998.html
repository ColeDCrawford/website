<HR><A NAME="Intro"></A>Introduction</H3>
If you are interested in learning about how to enjoy the outdoors in the
winter, then MITOC's Winter School, offered over IAP, is for you. Winter
School combines lectures (twice a week for four weeks) with weekend trips
to the mountains.

<P>The lectures cover such topics as proper clothing and gear, food, snow
shelters, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, mountaineering, and more.
They are designed for people who have no previous winter camping experience--beginners
are especially invited. Talks are often accompanied by slides from MITOC
members' expeditions around New England and around the world.

<P>Each weekend during IAP we organize multiple trips to the White Mountains
to practice the skills learned in the lectures. On the first weekend are
day hikes, while on the later weekends we go on overnight trips, culminating
in an attempt on Mt. Washington, the highest peak in the Presidentials.

<P><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">There is no charge for winter school and you do
not need to register in advance. Just show up to the weekly lectures! However,
to enhance everyone's saftety and enjoyment of the mountains we do require
that you attend all of the lectures in order to participate on our weekend
trips.</FONT>

One of the major attractions of Winter School is the annual lecture by
<B>Dr. Murray Hamlet</B> of the US Army on "Cold Weather Injuries." Dr.
Hamlet gives an informative, entertaining, and not a little disturbing
talk on how to understand and prevent cold weather injuries such as frostbite
and hypothermia. His slides are truly a must-see. Watch this space, or
the MITOC board in the infinite corridor, for the date and time of Dr.
Hamlet's lecture this January.
