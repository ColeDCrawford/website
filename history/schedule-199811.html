<td>New England Mountain Bike Festival Now in its fourth year, the Pedro's
Festival stands alone as a unique event in the mountain bike
community. Our definition of a mountain bike festival is a fun,
non-competitive weekend of bike and non-bike events created with the
family outdoor enthusiast in mind. The participant's playground is a
self- sufficient camping village designed to meet your every need,
allowing you to park your car for the weekend, and utilize bikes and
feet exclusively.

<td>The festival is a gathering of
paddlers from all across New England, and sometimes there are good deals on
used equipment.  Members from several outing clubs, notably us and RPI, will
be in attendance.  The river itself has two sections.  The bottom section is a pleasant
class II, although there some long swims if you miss a roll.  The upper section
is class III, with one fairly technical section.
We will leave Friday evening, and then camp like true outdoors folk
 in a campground near the river.  Breakfast and lunch will be up to
individuals, but the local church runs an all you can eat pasta bash
that shouldn't be missed.

the most popular activities of that time.  We will have a quick
canoe instruction for novices before paddling off into setting
sun and an evening of relaxation and conversation.  The moon will
rise to light our way.  Organized potluck in the canoes on the
river.  Bring $12 (per person for canoe rental), and an
appetizer, main dish, dessert or beverage to share.  Rain dates
will be arranged if necessary.

Spur or Tuckerman. Both days will include 10+ miles of hiking and an
altitude gain of 3-4000 feet. Some parts of the trail are a bit tricky
and the weather in the White Mountains region is highly unpredictable,

There is space for 20 persons at the cabin.  Stu Carpenter (the leader) has
bunks and kitchen equipment in the cabin so people will need to bring
sleeping gear and whatever outside stuff they want.  Plan on a group dinner
on Thanksgiving with Turkey and all of the trimmings.  Friday and Sat there
are plans to have a series of day trips and one of the group wants to lead
an overnight up in the high peaks area.  A friend of Stu's wants to hold a
forum on outdoor skills on Friday and may plan to build a shelter to
overnight in.  This trip was a lot of fun last year and Stu expects to have
a wait list for the trip this year.
