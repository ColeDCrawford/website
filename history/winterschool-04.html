<h1>Winter School 2004</h1>
<A NAME="Intro"></A>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Every year MITOC organizes a set of lectures, demonstrations, and
winter trips know collectively as Winter School.  This year the
tradition will continue with a variety of lectures and a multitude
of trips for all skill levels.

<P>The lectures cover such topics as proper clothing and gear, food,
snow shelters, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, mountaineering, and
more.  Each weekend during IAP we organize multiple trips to the White
Mountains to practice the skills learned in the lectures.  You can
<A href="../rentals/rentals.html">rent</a> most of the technical
equipment needed for these trips from MITOC.
                                                        
<P>There is no charge for winter school and you do not need to
register in advance. Just show up to the weekly lectures!  However, to
enhance everyone's safety and enjoyment of the mountains we do require
that you attend all of the mandatory lectures in order to participate
in our weekend trips.  (Trips usually have small charges associated with
them, to cover costs of gear rental, gas, food, land use fees, etc.)

<br>Introduction to 
self-propelled wilderness winter travel. Two nights per week of lecture, 
plus trips every weekend for people who have been to the classes (rental 
gear available). Topics progress from daytrips to winter camping and 
mountaineering; will cover food, clothing, and travel by snowshoes, 
crampons and skis. Talks will include info on winter natural history, 
weather, map &amp; compass skills, self-arrest, safety, and cold weather 
injuries. All levels of experience welcome. NOTE: THE FIRST SEVERAL 
LECTURES ARE CUMULATIVE AND MANDATORY FOR PARTICIPATION IN WINTER 
TRIPS!
</blockquote>


<H2>Weekend Trips</H2>

<p>There will be trips every weekend, based on the materials built on
the previous lectures.  The sign ups will occur on Thursday.  
There will be office hours on Thrusday right after lectures to obtain the 
material for the weekends.  Transportation and leaders are usually 
the limiting factors, so if you have friends with cars, encourage them to 
come.

<p>If you or a friend have some winter/cold weather experience,
please consider leading or co-leading a trip; contact us at
<a href="mailto:mitoc-owner@mit.edu">mitoc-owner@mit.edu</A>
to sign up.</P>

<p>In order to participate in a
weekend trip, you need to attend all mandatory lectures up to and
including the last Thursday before the trip weekend.  Individual
trip leaders have the final decision if they do not feel a person
has the proper knowledge or preparation for a trip.

<p>The below schedule of trips is very tentative, and <b>not
complete</b>.  These trips could change, and there will be many other
trips announced on Thursday lectures.

<p>Do NOT email the trip leaders to sign up for the 
trips. Trip signup will be done in person at Winter School letures. Trip 
leader email addresses are provided in case you have questions about the 
trips.</p>
